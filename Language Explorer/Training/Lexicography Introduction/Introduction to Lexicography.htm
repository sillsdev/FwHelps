	  </h1>
	  <p>Lexicography is the study of words along with the principles and procedures for describing them in a dictionary. A language
		 contains many words, each of which must be described phonologically, grammatically, and semantically. So the task of completely
		 describing the words of a language is huge. Dictionaries are also rather complicated things, because they attempt to describe
		 complicated mental structures and linguistic behavior. So the task of understanding the complexity and keeping everything
		 straight is difficult. The lexicographer must collect, record, analyze, refine, print, and otherwise manage the data. So the
		 task requires a number of skills and tools.
	  </p>
	  <p>FieldWorks Language Explorer has been designed to make this task as easy, straightforward, and efficient as possible. It has
		 powerful tools for collecting words, developing entries, editing fields, and generating publishable documents. By managing
		 the complexity and reducing much of the tedium of data processing, Language Explorer frees researchers to do what computers
		 cannot: analyze the data and make decisions as to how lexemes should be represented in the dictionary.
	  </p>
	  <p>The purpose of this paper is to introduce you to various issues in lexicography and how they are handled in Language Explorer.
		 You can either read through the whole paper or use it as a resource whenever you encounter a problem in lexicography or a
		 feature of the program that you don't understand. Section <a href="#sKeyIssues">2</a> "Key issues" introduces some key strategic and conceptual issues in lexicography that have influenced the design of Language
		 Explorer or have influenced my own approach to lexicography. Section <a href="#sLinguisticUnits">3</a> "Important concepts and how to handle them" describes various linguistic units and issues in lexicography, and explains how
		 to handle them in Language Explorer. Section <a href="#sProcedure">4</a> "Recommended step by step procedure for developing a dictionary" presents my personal view about how to produce a dictionary
		 in an efficient and effective way, especially for languages that have been inadequately documented and described. Section
		 <a href="#sTour">5</a> "A grand tour of Language Explorer" explains many of the features, areas, and fields in Language Explorer and how to use
		 them to produce a dictionary. Section <a href="#sEntry">6</a> "The entry" briefly describes the structure of an entry in Language Explorer and then describes each field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit-Entry</span> pane.
	  </p>
	  <p>The examples in this paper are often made up on the basis of my own research. Sometimes they are based on information in The
		 American Heritage Dictionary <a href="#rAHD">Morris (1978)</a>, Longman Language Activator <a href="#rLongman">Summers (1993)</a>, Longman Dictionary of American English <a href="#rDictAmEng">Summers and Gadsby (2002)</a>, The Merrian-Webster dictionary <a href="#rWoolf">Woolf (1974)</a>, or Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament Based on Semantic Domains <a href="#rLouwNida">Louw and Nida (1989)</a>. In each case I have shortened or adapted the entries to fit my purpose. So any inadequacies in the examples are due to my
		 editing.
	  </p>
	  <p>The views presented in this paper are my own. I alone am to blame for any inaccuracies or bad advice. Language Explorer has
		 been under development for many years and is still being developed. In preparation for the most recent release of the program
		 (November, 2014) I have revised and expanded this paper. I have attempted to accurately describe how the program currently
		 works, but may have missed some recent changes or failed to find and correct out-of-date statements.
	  </p>
	  <h1 style=""><a name="sKeyIssues"></a>2&nbsp;Key issues
	  </h1>
	  <p>In order to produce a dictionary we must understand some of the issues lexicographers face and the nature of the subject we
		 seek to describe.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sStrategicIssues"></a>2.1&nbsp;Strategic issues
	  </h2>
	  <p>The following are some crucial observations about dictionaries and the implications for what we do.</p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sMassiveNo"></a>2.1.1&nbsp;Massive numbers
	  </h3>
	  <p>There are approximately 6,000 languages in the world. Linguists estimate that there are an average of 25,000 unique words
		 in most languages. If we count lexical phrases and secondary senses, there are around 50,000 lexical units in most languages.
		 Most lexemes require around 20 fields to adequately describe them. Each field contains an average of 10 characters. So to
		 completely describe all the lexemes of every language means that we have to collect and type 60,000,000,000 characters.
	  </p>
	  <p>With huge numbers such as these, efficiency is not an option. It must be an essential feature of our strategy. It would take
		 an unacceptable amount of time to type all the data and edit it one piece at a time. We must find efficient ways to enter
		 and edit data if we want to make rapid progress. In Language Explorer the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span> tool and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries</span> tools were specifically designed to meet this need.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="s50000"></a>2.1.2&nbsp;50,000 lexical units versus 50 fields
	  </h3>
	  <p>Consider the following view of a Koine Greek dictionary database:</p>

	  </div>
	  <p class="pc">Consider that there are approximately 50,000 lexical units (including lexical phrases and senses) in most languages. Therefore,
		 if this table were complete, there would be 50,000 rows. On the other hand, there are only around 50 fields needed for even
		 the most complex and complete entry for a lexeme. So, if this table were complete, there would only be 50 columns. That means
		 that there are 1,000 times more rows than columns.
	  </p>
	  <p>If you filled out one entry (row) at a time, you would have 50,000 tasks. But if you filled out one field (column) at a time,
		 then you would only have 50 tasks. I would rather do 50 tasks than 50,000. It is for this reason that Language Explorer has
		 tools for filling in an entire column quickly, efficiently, and consistently. In fact you can fill in many fields semi-automatically
		 using the tools in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries</span> pane. For the actual procedures for doing this see section <a href="#sProcedure">4</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer makes it possible for you to work on one entry at a time or one field at a time. For instance you could
		 start with the first entry in your database and fill in each field in the entry, then go on to the next entry, and so on until
		 you reached the last entry. Alternatively you could start with the first field and fill it in for every entry in your database,
		 then go on to the next field, and so on until you finished filling out each field. Actually it is necessary to work both ways.
		 There will be times when you will need to add an entry and fill it in completely. There will be other times when it is better
		 to fill in one field for each entry. For instance you could add the grammatical category (part of speech) for all the lexemes
		 at once. Some fields, such as the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field, have to be filled in one at a time; and there are some tasks that require you to go through each entry in your dictionary
		 one at a time.
	  </p>
	  <p>You might think that it doesn't really matter whether you work one row at a time or one column at a time. But it takes a lot
		 of time to produce a dictionary one entry at a time and there is very little we can do to help you speed up the process. However
		 there is a great deal we can do to help you fill in a particular field in an efficient way. It is sometimes possible to work
		 100 or even 1,000 times faster when filling in a field for each entry. (This is no exaggeration.) So, as much as possible,
		 you should work on one field at a time. I think you will find that it is far more efficient, and you will get far more done,
		 if you work one field at a time, rather than working one entry at a time. Whenever you can, work the columns, not the rows.
	  </p>
	  <p>Once you have filled in as many fields as you need, then you will go back and edit each entry. But you will be editing&#8212;correcting
		 and polishing, rather than doing a lot of tedious typing.
	  </p>
	  <p>It might help to understand this principle by thinking of an analogy. When someone cooks a meal of rice, vegetables, and meat,
		 they do not cook one grain of rice, then one piece of vegetable, then one piece of meat, then another grain of rice, another
		 piece of vegetable, another piece of meat, and so on. Instead they cook all the rice at one time, all the vegetables together,
		 and all the meat together. No one would cook thousands of grains of rice one at a time. It is far more efficient to cook them
		 all together. In the same way it is far more efficient to "cook" all the grammatical categories at one time, all the pronunciation
		 fields together, and all the reversal entries together.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sRepeatedAct"></a>2.1.3&nbsp;Repeated actions versus decision making
	  </h3>
	  <p>A computer can perform repetitious actions, but it cannot make decisions. Some of the actions involved in producing a dictionary
		 are repetitious. For instance you need to indicate the grammatical category of each word. In a large dictionary there are
		 thousands of nouns and verbs. So you need to decide which words are nouns and which are verbs. But once you have decided,
		 you have to type "noun" or "verb" and you have to do this thousands of times.
	  </p>
	  <p>One of the best uses of a computer is to do repetitious, automatic, or semiautomatic actions. Whenever I find myself doing
		 something over and over again, I try to find a way to get the computer to do it for me, or at least help me. This is especially
		 true of repetitious, tedious typing. The computer can often do the typing, freeing me to make the decisions that only I can
		 make. As much as possible you should avoid spending time on repetitious tasks. For this reason, Language Explorer contains
		 tools that &#8220;do the typing&#8221; for you. These tools can also enable you to achieve a higher level of accuracy and consistency.
	  </p>
	  <p>For instance there are techniques for identifying the grammatical category of many words (which I describe in Section <a href="#sSpecGramCat">4.2.4</a> "Specifying the grammatical category"). Briefly, you ask Language Explorer to filter the database for words that contain
		 a particular affix (for instance the English derivational suffix <span style="color:#0000ff; ">-ment</span>, which turns a verb into a noun). The program can do this in seconds. Then you ask it to assign the correct grammatical category
		 to those entries. This also takes just a few seconds. Using this technique, you can sometimes assign the correct grammatical
		 category to hundreds or thousands of words at once. This can save you days of tedious typing.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sStandVsFlex"></a>2.1.4&nbsp;Standardization versus flexibility
	  </h3>
	  <p>There are many kinds of languages and many kinds of dictionaries. Some languages have lots of affixation, others have little.
		 Some dictionaries are monolingual, others are bilingual. It would seem that flexibility would be essential and standardization
		 impossible. To a degree, that is true. A comparative dictionary of 40 related languages is very different in structure and
		 content from a monolingual dictionary. There are programs that would enable you to do both. But such programs pay a very heavy
		 price. They cannot constrain the data in any significant way. This permits the user to be flexible, but it also permits the
		 user to make lots of mistakes. Such programs have limited power, because the tools cannot assume anything about the data.
	  </p>
	  <p>On the other hand standardization opens up possibilities that flexibility rules out. For instance the structure of the data
		 can be standardized so that the user does not have to master the structure. This reduces the level of training required of
		 the lexicographer and enables him to concentrate on other things. Standardization eliminates many errors that occur in unconstrained
		 databases. Standardization permits the development of tools that require the data to be in a certain form.
	  </p>
	  <p>An analogy might help to understand this principle. Machines are often held together with bolts. Almost every bolt used today
		 has a head with six sides. Some old bolts had heads with four sides. It would also be possible to make a five-sided head or
		 a seven-sided head, but manufacturers have decided to standardize and use six sided heads. This makes it possible for millions
		 of us to have a few standardized tools that work on all standardized bolts. Otherwise we would need a set of tools for four
		 sided heads, another for five sided heads, and so on. For instance a wrench (spanner) for six sided heads would not work on
		 a five sided head. Standardization makes life a lot simpler and more efficient for all of us.
	  </p>

			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>Language Explorer has chosen to standardize some features, while permitting flexibility for others. There are pros and cons
		 to both standardization and flexibility, but some standardization is necessary for four primary reasons.
	  </p>
	  <ol style="list-style-type:decimal; ">
		 <li>Standardization reduces the burden on the user to maintain consistency in his data. The user does not need to worry about
			what field to use or what order the fields need to be in. The user does not have to add fields. All standard fields are built
			in and are always available.
		 </li>
		 <li>Standardization allows us to determine what kind of information will be contained in each field. The program knows what kind
			of information to expect in each standard field. For instance some fields will contain vernacular data. Other fields will
			contain descriptions in an analysis language. The contents of other fields (like grammatical category) are chosen from a limited
			list of possibilities. This enables us to build standard lists to fit standard fields.
		 </li>
		 <li>Standardization permits us to develop powerful tools that are dependent on standardized data. For instance we can build parsing
			tools that depend on the existence of certain information in specific fields. We can also easily create links between data,
			such as cross-references between entries, because the program knows what field to look for. We can build better displays,
			and standardize export and print functions.
		 </li>
		 <li>Standardization permits cross-linguistic comparisons in a web environment. Publishing multiple dictionaries using the same
			format opens up the possibility of using web-based search engines to do cross-linguistic comparisons between dictionaries.
		 </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>Unfortunately there is a down side to this choice. Language Explorer cannot support every kind of dictionary imaginable. At
		 the current state of development Language Explorer only supports the production of a dictionary that describes a single language.
		 The description may be in the same language (i.e. a monolingual dictionary), or the description may be in a second language
		 (i.e. a bilingual dictionary). In fact you can set up many analysis languages (languages you use to describe the words). But
		 you currently cannot produce a truly bilingual dictionary (i.e. L1-L2 and L2-L1) in the same project.<span style="font-size:65%; vertical-align:super">[<a href="#nBilingualDict">1</a>]</span> To do that, you would have to set up two separate projects in Language Explorer. You also cannot produce a comparative dictionary.
		 To do that, you would need to use an unconstrained program such as Toolbox.
	  </p>
	  <p>One of the things Language Explorer has standardized is the fields you see in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane of <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span>. The team that designed Language Explorer included the fields they believe are most often needed and structured them in a
		 linguistically sound way. You cannot delete any of these fields. But you can hide them if you don't want to use them. Lexicography
		 consultants have found that every lexicographer has trouble being consistent in labeling and ordering fields. Mistakes can
		 cause serious errors when you print your dictionary, resulting in wrongly formatted material or lost data. So Language Explorer
		 has chosen to standardize the fields to help you avoid errors and make your job easier.
	  </p>
	  <p>Although Language Explorer has opted for standardization, that doesn't mean that the program is entirely inflexible. You can
		 set up custom fields for special needs. You can use multiple scripts to transcribe vernacular words. You can set up multiple
		 analysis languages. You can determine which fields you will use and which fields you see in each display. You can specify
		 which entries will be exported for publication. You can specify which fields will be exported and how they will be formatted.
		 This allows you to maintain a single database, yet produce multiple publications.
	  </p>
	  <p>The Language Explorer team has tried to strike a happy balance between standardization and flexibility. They have standardized
		 where it seemed beneficial and allowed for flexibility where it was needed. I hope you will be happy with their choices.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sTechReq"></a>2.1.5&nbsp;Technical requirements of the lexicographer
	  </h3>
	  <p>Lexicography is not an easy task. The lexicographer must have a background in many fields of linguistics--phonology, grammar,
		 semantics, sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, to name a few. To use a computer the lexicographer must have basic computer
		 skills. He must be able to manage a large project. It would seem that the task requires a professional lexicographer. But
		 many dictionaries have been produced by field linguists, anthropologists, language learning specialists, and others.
	  </p>
	  <p>Sometimes the question is asked, "How can we make lexicography accessible to native speakers of a language who wish to produce
		 a dictionary of their own language, but do not have training in linguistics or lexicography?" One of the goals of SIL is to
		 empower local people with limited resources to develop their own language. It would be nice if there was a professional lexicographer
		 who was available to work on each language in the world and who was also a native speaker of the language. Even if there were,
		 there frequently isn't much money available to fund minority language dictionaries. In order to produce a dictionary for every
		 language in the world, we must recruit more lexicographers, raise more funds, or make it possible for non-linguists to help.
	  </p>
	  <p>There is no way to simplify language. But there are ways to simplify the process of investigating and describing it. The primary
		 means of doing this is to divide the task into manageable steps and simplify each step. A step can be made easy by working
		 out a method of accomplishing the step and providing everything a person needs to do that step.
	  </p>
	  <p>For instance the first step in producing a dictionary is to collect words. But the process of collecting words has always
		 been difficult and slow. So I developed a method of collecting words that is highly efficient and easy. The materials and
		 tools necessary to collect words and enter them have been incorporated into Language Explorer in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span> area. The method is easy to learn. Non-linguists can be taught to collect and enter words into the program in about ten minutes.
		 For more on the word collection method see the Rapid Word Collection website (http://rapidwords.net/).
	  </p>
	  <p>We cannot make the total process of producing a dictionary so easy that a non-linguist can do it all. Certain steps, such
		 as determining which grammatical categories exist in the language, require input from a linguist. A computer powerful enough
		 to run Language Explorer (or any other dictionary software) is not a simple machine. Often special fonts and keyboard managers
		 must be installed. It is unrealistic to assume that a poorly educated person can produce a linguistically sophisticated dictionary.
		 But an illiterate person can help to collect words. Language Explorer empowers people to participate in the process by enabling
		 them to do specific steps. In addition there are many educated people who speak minority languages who can produce a dictionary
		 if they have the resources and training.
	  </p>
	  <p>It is easy for someone beginning a dictionary project to be overwhelmed by the magnitude of the task and the complexity of
		 a program like Language Explorer. The team that developed Language Explorer tried to simplify the task and deal with the complexity.
		 They paid attention to the methodology and mechanics of doing each step involved in producing a dictionary. They reduced the
		 complexity in various ways. For instance some features are built into the program so the user doesn't have to deal with them.
		 They also provided options, such as hiding fields, to limit what the user sees on the screen. They continue to develop shortcuts
		 and eliminate clunky features such as unnecessary mouse clicks. You can help by joining the FLEx users group (http://groups.google.com/flex-list/subscribe?hl=en)
		 where you can ask questions and make suggestions for improvement.
	  </p>
	  <p>Having said all this, we still recognize that Language Explorer is a complicated program. So SIL has developed a companion
		 program, WeSay, that can be used by native speakers of a language to do much of the basic data gathering. WeSay was designed
		 to be used on portable battery-operated computing devices in remote locations. Data collected in WeSay can be read by Language
		 Explorer. For more on WeSay see their website (http://www.wesay.org/wiki/Main_Page).
	  </p>
	  <p>If you follow the methodology suggested in this paper, you will gradually be introduced to the features of the program that
		 support dictionary making. There is no need for you to be overwhelmed by the power and array of features built into the program.
		 This document, together with the demo movies and help files, will lead you step by step from setup to the completion of the
		 project. SIL is developing resources, tools, and training materials to help you. In this way we are doing our best to empower
		 you to easily and efficiently produce a massive, well-developed dictionary that would be the envy of previous generations
		 of lexicographers.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sTextCorpVsInt"></a>2.1.6&nbsp;Text corpus evidence versus intuition
	  </h3>
	  <p>The first large computerized text corpus of English was developed in the 1970s. When lexicographers started using this corpus
		 to investigate the meaning and usage of words, they were surprised at how often the data in the text corpus was at variance
		 with their dictionary entries&#8212;entries that had been written on the basis of native speaker intuition. They found that many
		 words were used in ways that no dictionary described. In other cases the dictionary definitions weren't quite right or the
		 example sentences were not typical of how the word was used.<span style="font-size:65%; vertical-align:super">[<a href="#nPersonalExp">2</a>]</span> It appeared that the native speaker intuition of lexicographers had sometimes failed. Why is this?
	  </p>
	  <p>It appears that we are very much aware of some aspects of language, while other aspects are buried deep in our subconscious.
		 We can illustrate this from phonology. Most people have no problem recognizing that the words <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'divine'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'divinity'</span> are related both in form and meaning. These facts are &#8216;obvious&#8217; to us. But most people are not aware that they change the
		 pronunciation of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'divine</span>' when the suffix <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'-ity'</span> is added to it. <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'Divine'</span> [<span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">d&#618;vajn</span>] becomes <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'divin'</span> [<span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">d&#618;v&#618;n</span>] because of a phonological rule. People make the change entirely subconsciously and are only aware of it when it is pointed
		 out to them.
	  </p>
	  <p>Similarly many aspects of the way we use words are buried in our subconscious. We only become aware of them when they are
		 brought to our attention. This is the great benefit of the text corpus method. Studying actual examples of usage brings to
		 our attention those rules of usage that are buried in our subconscious. Because of this lexicographers concluded that dictionaries
		 ought to be based on text corpus evidence and that intuition alone is unreliable. They still needed their native speaker intuition
		 to make sense of the text corpus data and to supply information that cannot be gleaned from texts. But the text corpus method
		 revolutionized lexicography for major languages.
	  </p>
	  <p>Corpus linguistics has developed into a significant branch of linguistics, with its own methods, software, theories, and insights.
		 There is certainly more to linguistics and lexicography than just corpus studies. In fact I would say that it is just one
		 tool available to us. But we would be very foolish indeed to neglect this growing field.
	  </p>
	  <p>Unfortunately lexicography for minority languages has lagged behind this trend because lexicographers working on minority
		 languages face several unique problems. In some languages there are no written texts of any kind. You can hardly employ the
		 corpus method with no texts. In some cases the creation of a text corpus may first require the development of an orthography,
		 the development of a literacy program, and the development of a literature by encouraging people to start writing. An alternative
		 is to record (or video) oral literature, speeches, and conversations and then employ someone to transcribe the recordings.
	  </p>
	  <p>Some languages are highly inflecting. These languages require a linguist to develop a parser that can annotate the texts and
		 indicate the lexeme form (or citation form) of each inflected word. The reason is that a concordance program cannot work adequately
		 when there are scores, hundreds, or even thousands of possible inflected forms of each stem. A concordance program must be
		 able to pull together all the inflected forms of a stem and display them together.
	  </p>
	  <p>Minority languages often lack sufficient resources to develop a large corpus. It takes time and money to collect texts, transcribe
		 oral texts, and enter the data into the program. It takes a linguist with good computer and analytical skills to develop a
		 parser.
	  </p>
	  <p>Even if your resources are seriously limited, you should collect as many texts as you can and add them to the text corpus
		 in Language Explorer. If you have a text that has been typed, you can cut and paste it into Language Explorer without having
		 to go through a complicated import procedure. So you can build a text corpus as fast as you can collect texts.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer also has an interlinearizer and a built in parser that enable you to analyze inflected languages. Part of
		 the process of interlinearizing a text is to identify the lexeme form (or citation form) of each word in the text and link
		 each inflected form to the correct dictionary entry. This in turn enables you to generate a concordance of either a particular
		 wordform or a lexeme. So Language Explorer is designed to enable you to use the corpus method even if your language is highly
		 inflecting.
	  </p>
	  <p>Many of the tasks involved in producing a dictionary can be accomplished without a text corpus. But there are two steps that
		 benefit from the corpus method. The first is collecting words. I believe that using semantic domains to collect words is by
		 far the most efficient and effective method. But generating a list of the words that occur in your text corpus will ensure
		 that you have all the common words in your dictionary. It will also turn up many words that the semantic domain method will
		 miss. So I recommend that you use both methods.
	  </p>
	  <p>The second step that benefits from the corpus method is semantic research. Although there are a number of tools for doing
		 corpus research, the two primary ones are a tool that generates a concordance of a word and a tool that lists the collocates
		 of a word. Language Explorer can generate a concordance, but unfortunately it does not yet have a collocate tool.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sCollaboration"></a>2.1.7&nbsp;Collaboration
	  </h3>
	  <p>Some lexicographers have labored their entire life to produce one incomplete dictionary of a language. The job is really too
		 big for one person. Major publishers employ large teams to work on a new edition of a dictionary. How can we work together
		 on a single dictionary when we are scattered all over the geographical area where a language is spoken or when we want help
		 from a consultant on another continent?
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer was designed with this need in mind. It is now possible for a team to work remotely on a single project.</p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sMentalLexicon"></a>2.2&nbsp;The mental lexicon, lexical databases, and published dictionaries
	  </h2>
	  <p>The primary task of a lexicographer is to figure out what is in the mental lexicon and describe it in a published dictionary.
		 There are major differences between the lexicon in a person's mind, a lexical database in a computer, and a published dictionary.
		 We will discuss three major issues--the nature of the information, the organization of the information, and the presentation
		 of the information. One reason why this is important is that we must clearly understand the difference between how information
		 is stored by Language Explorer and how it is presented on screen and in print. It is stored in one form, but we can view it
		 and publish it in a variety of forms.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sNature"></a>2.2.1&nbsp;The nature of lexical information
	  </h3>
	  <p>Physicists claim they are close to describing all the laws that govern the physical universe. By way of contrast, we have
		 barely scratched the surface of lexicography. We have no idea how the mind stores words (or even if it stores words). We have
		 no idea how the mind accesses lexical information when we speak or listen. We have no idea if there are such things as "definitions"
		 in the mind. We don't even know if there is anything in the mind that corresponds to a dictionary. All we can do is observe
		 how people use language and try to describe what they do.
	  </p>
	  <p>Think for a moment about how your brain might store the word &#8216;house&#8217;. We have no way of finding the place in your brain where
		 &#8216;house&#8217; is stored or knowing exactly how it stores it, but we can at least make some observations. You can pronounce the word,
		 understand it when it is spoken, and use it in a sentence with correct grammar. You can picture a house in your mind, describe
		 it by listing the features of a house (e.g. people live in it), tell what kind of a thing it is (a building), tell how it
		 differs from other kinds of buildings, describe a typical house, and tell if a building should be called a house or not. But
		 we have almost no idea how the mind stores this information, or in what form it stores it. We know what people can do with
		 words, but we cannot observe the mind directly. So a dictionary is really a representation of information that linguists can
		 glean from observing how people use words.
	  </p>
	  <p>A computer programmer could tell you how a program such as Language Explorer actually stores information. For our purpose
		 it is enough to note that we can store pieces of written material (like a definition), a picture, or a sound file. Obviously
		 computer files are quite different from what is in your brain. The challenge is to capture the information in our brains in
		 a form that we can put into a computer. But we are severely limited by two things--our lack of understanding of the mental
		 lexicon, and the comparatively simple nature of computer files.
	  </p>
	  <p>Up until recently, all dictionaries were printed on paper, and many still are. A language has a lot of words, so dictionaries
		 tend to be big and expensive. To make them affordable, publishers want to keep them as short as possible. So they use abbreviations
		 and short definitions to keep each entry as short as possible. But this means that printed dictionaries are only poor representations
		 of the mental dictionary.
	  </p>
	  <p>To illustrate this problem, consider the following dictionary entry:</p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xHouse">(3)</a></td>
			   <td>
				  <table>
					 <tr>
						<td>
						   <div style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; text-indent:-.4in; padding-left:.4in; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">house</span> [haws] <span style="font-style:italic; ">n</span>. a building used as a dwelling for a single family. <span style="font-style:italic; ">We've just moved into a new two story house.</span> [Old English <span style="font-style:italic; ">hus</span>, from Germanic <span style="font-style:italic; ">husam</span>]
						   </div>
						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>The first part of the entry gives the spelling of the word. But we had to go to school to learn how to spell. We store the
		 spelling of a word in our minds, but people who don&#8217;t know how to read and write don&#8217;t have this information.
	  </p>
	  <p>The second part indicates how the word is pronounced, but it is in writing, too. So it is only a poor indication of the knowledge
		 we have in our minds about how to produce the word with our mouth or how we recognize the word when we hear it.
	  </p>
	  <p>The third part indicates the word is a noun, but we had to go to school to learn what a noun is. Somehow the word &#8216;noun&#8217; is
		 supposed to indicate how the word functions in the grammar. We know in our heads how to use nouns, but putting &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic; ">n</span>.&#8221; in a dictionary doesn&#8217;t capture what this information really is. So this is also a poor indication of what is in our heads.
	  </p>
	  <p>The fourth part of the entry is called a definition. But we don&#8217;t really know if the brain stores definitions or some other
		 kind of representation of a word&#8217;s "meaning."
	  </p>
	  <p>The fifth part of the entry is an example sentence. A speaker could say this sentence, but it isn&#8217;t stored permanently in
		 his mind.
	  </p>
	  <p>The last part of the entry is called the etymology (the history of the word). Nobody knows this information unless they have
		 studied the history of words. So this part of the entry doesn&#8217;t even represent what is in people&#8217;s minds. It is historical
		 information about the word, but isn&#8217;t information that the average person stores in his head.
	  </p>
	  <p>Today many dictionaries are published electronically. This enables us to include more information because the size of the
		 dictionary doesn't appreciably increase the cost of publication (although it stills costs more to collect the information).
		 The main difference between an electronic dictionary and a printed dictionary is that an electronic dictionary is much more
		 like a dictionary database. You can attach sound files to each entry in an electronic dictionary, something that you can't
		 do in print. The usefulness of an electronic dictionary is determined by the user interface. A good interface will allow the
		 user to search for an entry, jump from one entry to another, listen to sound files, and even use links to access information
		 outside the dictionary, for instance by jumping to an Internet site. So an electronic dictionary is slightly better than a
		 printed dictionary in representing the mental lexicon, but not much. For some languages an electronic dictionary is far superior
		 to a printed dictionary because of the difficulty of finding words. An electronic dictionary can contain many more minor entries
		 and cross-references. Language Explorer enables you to produce an electronic dictionary that does all these things (currently
		 via programs like Lexique Pro), but an electronic dictionary is still like a printed dictionary in that it is a poor representation
		 of the mental lexicon.
	  </p>
	  <p>In linguistics we sometimes use the term &#8216;lexicon&#8217; to refer to all the words in a language, or to refer to all the words that
		 exist in a single person&#8217;s mind. In this document I use the term 'mental lexicon' to refer to what is in a person's head.
		 In contrast the term &#8216;dictionary&#8217; usually refers to a published document which (we hope) is a good representation of the mental
		 lexicon. A computer representation of the lexicon is sometimes called a &#8216;dictionary database&#8217; or a &#8216;machine readable dictionary&#8217;.
		 In Language Explorer the database is called the 'lexicon' and a publication (print or electronic) is called the 'dictionary'.
		 The best way to get from the mental lexicon to a published document is to develop a computer database where we can collect,
		 store, and develop the information. So a computer database is something in between the mental lexicon and the published document.
	  </p>
	  <p>From this discussion it should be obvious that a published dictionary is a very abbreviated and abstract representation of
		 the mental lexicon. We might want the two to be more similar. But a lexicographer must produce a document that people can
		 use. So the usability of a published dictionary becomes one of the most important factors in what information we include in
		 the dictionary and how it is presented.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sOrganization"></a>2.2.2&nbsp;The organization of information
	  </h3>
	  <p>Most dictionaries are organized by alphabetizing the headwords. However words are not stored in the mind in an alphabetized
		 list. Very few people could tell you what word comes after <span style="color:#0000ff; ">next</span> in the dictionary. (In my Webster&#8217;s Unabridged Dictionary <a href="#rMckechnie">McKechnie (1976)</a> it is <span style="color:#0000ff; ">next-door</span>.) Instead words are organized in groups of semantically related words. The primary evidence for this is the ease with which
		 people can call to mind words that are related in meaning.
	  </p>
	  <p>When we speak, we can call up words almost instantly. When we have a topic in our minds, we can call up any word we want to
		 express some idea related to that topic. When we write, we may pause and search our minds for the best word to use in the
		 context. So we are working from meaning to form. Therefore we conclude that words are stored in the mind on the basis of meaning.
	  </p>
	  <p>Of course when we are listening, our minds have to work in the opposite direction. So we also store a representation of the
		 sound pattern of words, which we access when we hear a word. But these patterns are not stored alphabetically.
	  </p>
	  <p>The point is that the mental lexicon is organized both by meaning and by form. Therefore a published dictionary could also
		 be organized either by meaning or by form.
	  </p>
	  <p>So why do we alphabetize dictionaries? We do so because the form of words is easily accessible to our conscious minds. We
		 have learned our ABC's. We have learned to read. We have learned how words are spelled. So we can find words that are listed
		 alphabetically. When we alphabetize a dictionary, our primary concern is to make it easy for the user to find the word he
		 is looking for.
	  </p>
	  <p>Unfortunately the meaning of words has not been codified in a rigorous system like the form of words has been through writing.
		 Consequently it is more difficult to find words in a meaning-based dictionary. Even so, a meaning-based dictionary is extremely
		 useful. A writer or translator may be searching for alternate ways to express a particular meaning. He is working from meaning
		 to form. For him an alphabetized dictionary is almost useless because it works from form to meaning. He needs something like
		 a thesaurus that is organized by meaning. So there is a value to both form-based (alphabetized) and meaning-based dictionaries.
		 Language Explorer enables you to produce both.
	  </p>
	  <p>Form and meaning are just two pieces of information in each entry. Language Explorer enables you to sort the dictionary on
		 any field in browse view. It also enables you to filter the dictionary in powerful ways to find the information you want to
		 work on. The combination of the various views, the sort function, and the filter function enables you to organize your data
		 in many creative ways to make it easy to enter, view, analyze, and edit the data.
	  </p>
	  <p>One of the most significant ways in which the mind organizes the mental lexicon is by forming links between pieces of data.
		 A particular form is linked to a particular meaning, or to several meanings. A particular meaning is associated with a particular
		 grammatical pattern of use. A form may be linked to another form, for instance a derivative. The meaning of one word may be
		 linked to the meaning of another, for instance as synonyms or antonyms. Some of these links are captured in Language Explorer
		 simply through the structure of an entry. Other links, for instance those between forms, must be created by you. Because there
		 are a variety of kinds of relationships, there are several systems used by Language Explorer to link different kinds of data.
		 One system enables you to link forms that are morphologically related to each other. Another system enables you to link a
		 sense of one entry with a sense of another entry using what are called lexical relations. These links enable you to do two
		 basic things, (1) link the two pieces of data, and (2) specify the kind of relationship between them.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer uses what is called a "relational database." This makes is a very powerful tool for linking various pieces
		 of information together. It also makes it a powerful tool for organizing and displaying the information in creative and powerful
		 ways.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sDataVsPresent"></a>2.2.3&nbsp;Data versus presentation
	  </h3>
	  <p>It is important to recognize the difference between data itself and the presentation of that data. Language Explorer takes
		 care of storing the information you collect on your computer. Unlike some dictionary software, it stores your data in a series
		 of database tables. It is very difficult to read the information directly from the tables. So Language Explorer displays the
		 information on screen in a form that we can read and interact with. All computer programs store information in one form (ultimately
		 in binary code), but display it on screen in a form we can understand. A simple program will display a simple file, such as
		 a straight text file, in only one way. But a sophisticated program like Language Explorer can present your data on screen
		 in many different ways. We call these 'views' of the data. The data is the same in all the views, but we can select what we
		 see and how it is arranged on the screen. We can also decide how it will be presented for publication.
	  </p>
	  <p>There are three basic types of views in Language Explorer--edit view, browse view, and publication view. An edit view separates
		 each field in a record and places each field on a separate line. This makes it easy to see and edit each field in a record.
		 A browse view places each record on a separate line and puts each field in a separate column. This makes it easy to compare
		 the data in several records at once. A publication view shows how the data will look (or could look) when it is published.
	  </p>
	  <p>The program has several edit and browse views to enable you to enter and edit your data in powerful ways. You can edit the
		 data in the browse views as well as the edit views, although there are limitations on what fields you can edit in the browse
		 views. You can change these views in a number of ways to make it easier to accomplish different tasks.
	  </p>
	  <p>The program also has several publication views in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon</span> pane--<span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Classified Dictionary</span>, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Indexes</span>. You cannot edit the data in any of these views. They are included merely to show you how your data could look in print.
		 However you can change various settings in the program that change how the data is presented. You can also export the data
		 in various formats, such as XML, SFM, or LIFT. The exported file can then be processed by other software, such as Lexique
		 Pro, in order to format it for printing or for publication on the Internet. In this way Language Explorer makes it possible
		 to maintain a single database, but export the data in multiple formats for various kinds of dictionaries.
	  </p>
	  <p>The primary view of the data is called the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span> view. It is a combination of each of the three basic types of views. The left pane is the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entries</span> pane which consists of a browse view. The right pane is the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane which displays a single entry at a time. When you select an entry in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entries</span> pane, it will be displayed in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane consists of a dictionary view at the top and an edit view at the bottom. The dictionary view enables you to see how
		 the entry will appear in print with the settings you have currently chosen. The edit view enables you to edit each field of
		 the entry.
	  </p>
	  <p>There are also three other browse views. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Browse</span> pane is simply a browse view that fills the screen. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries</span> pane enables you to edit a single field and has tools that enable you to edit that field in many entries at once. It enables
		 you to edit the columns, rather than the rows, as discussed in section <a href="#s50000">2.1.2</a>. It automatically places each instance of the field that you want to edit on a separate line. Since an entry may have more
		 than instance of a field, such as the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field or the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Example Sentences</span> field, this enables you to see all the instances of the field so that you can sort and filter them. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Reversal Entries</span> pane makes the same tools available to work on reversal entries.

	  <p>There is also a very specialized view, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span>, that was designed to enable you to enter lots of new words efficiently using the Dictionary Development Process list of
		 semantic domains. All of these views are views of a single database. The data is the same in each view. Language Explorer
		 merely presents it differently in order to facilitate a variety of tasks. The rest of this paper describes how to use the

	  <h1 style=""><a name="sLinguisticUnits"></a>3&nbsp;Important concepts and how to handle them
	  </h1>
	  <p>In order to produce a dictionary we must understand the various types of lexical units and how to handle them in Language
		 Explorer. Linguists use the terms 'word', 'morpheme', 'allomorph', 'affix', 'root', 'stem', 'derivative', 'compound', and
		 'phrase' to refer to various kinds of linguistic units. Lexicographers use the terms 'lexeme', 'headword', 'citation form',
		 'complex form', and 'variant' to refer to linguistic units that are important for lexicography. They also use the terms 'main
		 entry', 'subentry', and 'minor entry' to refer to various kinds of dictionary entries. Some of these terms are frequently
		 confused.
	  </p>
	  <p>It is vitally important that you understand these terms so that you put the correct information in the right field and label
		 the information correctly. Many of the features of Language Explorer depend on fields containing the type of information they
		 were designed for. For instance Language Explorer has special tools and features for handling variants and allomorphs. There
		 is also a procedure for linking complex forms, such as compounds, to their roots. The program can automatically do a lot of
		 work for you. It can cross-reference entries, create subentries in a root dictionary, create minor subentries in a stem dictionary,
		 and much else. But it can only do these things if you understand the various kinds of units and what to do with them.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sBasicTerms"></a>3.1&nbsp;Basic terms
	  </h2>
	  <p>The following are some basic terms and how they are used in Language Explorer.</p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sLexeme"></a>3.1.1&nbsp;Lexeme
	  </h3>
	  <p>In lexicography we use the term lexeme to refer to a unit in the mental lexicon. Sometimes the term is defined as the minimal
		 unit of the semantic system<span style="font-size:65%; vertical-align:super">[<a href="#nLexeme">3</a>]</span> and sometimes it is used to refer to a combination of a form and a single sense. But in Language Explorer it is used to refer
		 to the mental equivalent of a dictionary entry. So a lexeme can have more than one sense. A lexeme can be a morpheme, word,
		 or lexical phrase, because each is a form with an associated meaning. If a lexeme is a stem, all the inflected forms of the
		 stem are included. So a lexeme is a stem and all its inflected forms. If the lexeme has allomorphs or variants, they too are
		 included. So a lexeme is an abstract unit. A lexeme can have more than one pronunciation and more than one meaning. It can
		 be inflected in different ways and even belong to more than one grammatical category.
	  </p>
	  <p>In order to be able to talk about a lexeme, we usually refer to it using its basic pronunciation. So we speak of the lexeme
		 <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'house'</span> or the lexeme <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'love'</span>. We say that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'house'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'houses'</span> are forms of the lexeme <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'house'</span>; we say that '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">love' (noun)</span> and '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">love' (verb)</span> both belong to the lexeme <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'love'</span>; and we say that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'love'</span> <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'to really like something'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'love'</span> <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'to care for someone'</span> are two senses of the lexeme <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'love'</span>.
	  </p>
	  <p>In Language Explorer we create an entry for each lexeme. The basic form of the lexeme is put in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field. We record the allomorphs and variants of the lexeme, create a sense for each meaning, and describe all aspects of
		 its form, meaning, and usage.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sWord"></a>3.1.2&nbsp;Word, wordform
	  </h3>
	  <p>The term 'word' is something that we all understand, but is a little hard to define accurately. One problem is that people,
		 including linguists, use the term 'word' in many ways. Linguists define a grammatical word in various ways depending on their
		 theoretical perspective. A phonological word is the smallest thing that we can say in normal speech. An orthographic word
		 is something written with a space (or punctuation) on either side. Unfortunately grammatical words, phonological words, and
		 orthographic words are not always the same thing. For instance the English word 'a' is written as a separate word, but is
		 actually a clitic.<span style="font-size:65%; vertical-align:super">[<a href="#nClitic">4</a>]</span></p>
	  <p>When we talk about the words in a dictionary, we sometimes use the term 'word' rather loosely. The entries in a dictionary
		 are not all words. Some of them are affixes and some are phrases. To be more precise we could use the term 'lexeme' for a
		 unit in the mental lexicon, 'entry' for a unit in the database, and 'article' for a unit in the published dictionary. But
		 in order to communicate more easily and naturally, most lexicographers (including me) sometimes use the term 'word' to mean
		 'lexeme in the lexicon', 'entry in the database' or 'article in the dictionary'. However Language Explorer uses 'word' as
		 a technical term to refer to an orthographic word in a text. In Language Explorer the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word Analyses</span> area contains a list of words that occur in your text corpus. In the interlinear display the first line is called the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word</span> line.
	  </p>
	  <p>In Language Explorer the term 'wordform' means the same thing as 'word'. Both refer to orthographic words. The term 'wordform'
		 refers just to the written form, irrespective of whether it has variant pronunciations or multiple meanings. The English words
		 'color' and 'colour' are two different wordforms. Homographs share the same wordform, even though we would say they are different
		 lexemes. In the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts &amp; Words-Word List Concordance</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word Analyses</span>, and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Wordforms</span> areas the center pane is called the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Wordforms</span> pane and contains a list of all the words in your texts. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> files will sometimes refer to this list as the "wordform inventory." The words in the list might be inflected or uninflected.
		 So the list of wordforms is not the same as the list of lexemes in the lexicon.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sMorpheme"></a>3.1.3&nbsp;Morpheme
	  </h3>
	  <p>Consider the word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">colts</span>. It is composed of two parts: <span style="color:#0000ff; ">colt</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">-s</span>. Each part has a meaning. The root <span style="color:#0000ff; ">colt</span> means <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'a baby horse'</span> and the suffix <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'-s'</span> means <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'Plural'</span>. We use the term 'morpheme' to refer to the smallest part of a word that has a meaning. So <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'colt'</span> and '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">-s'</span> are both morphemes. Morphemes can be roots or affixes.
	  </p>
	  <p>A morpheme is not the same thing as a letter. The word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'colts'</span> is composed of the letters c, o, l, t, and s. But as letters they have no meaning and therefore are not morphemes. Although
		 the letter 'c' is part of the word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'colts'</span>, in the context of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'colts'</span> it has no meaning. The letter 's' in the word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'desk'</span> is not a morpheme, because it has no meaning in the context of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'desk'</span>. But the 's' in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'colts'</span> is a morpheme because it means <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'Plural'</span> in the context in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'colts'</span>. Morphemes can consist of a single letter or a string of letters. The word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'unrealistic'</span> is composed of a root <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'real</span>' and three derivational affixes '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">un-'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'-ist</span>', and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'-ic</span>'. Each of the four parts has a meaning and therefore is a morpheme.
	  </p>
	  <p>Some lexicographers include all morphemes in their dictionaries. Other lexicographers only include those morphemes that can
		 occur as a full word by themselves. However in order to parse words and interlinearize texts you need to include all morphemes
		 in the lexicon. (If you only want to parse down to the stem level, you can ignore derivational affixes.) You can include a
		 morpheme in the lexicon but exclude it from the dictionary by putting a check in the box in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Exclude As Headword</span> field. I would recommend that you include all morphemes in your dictionary. One purpose of a dictionary is to document and
		 describe a language for all those who wish to know more about it. Scholars and future generations will appreciate a description
		 of roots and affixes as well as full words and lexical phrases.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sRoot"></a>3.1.4&nbsp;Root
	  </h3>
	  <p>A root is a morpheme (a part of a word) that is the primary or basic part of the word. In the example <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'colts'</span> (above), <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'colt'</span> is the root. Roots like <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'colt</span>' can usually occur by themselves as full words.
	  </p>
	  <p>If a root cannot occur by itself, it is called a "bound root." An example of a bound root is the Greek word <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">ikhthus</span> (written <span style="font-family:Galatia SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">&#7984;&#967;&#952;&#973;&#962;</span> in the Greek orthography), meaning <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'fish'</span>. The root is <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">ikhthu</span> (<span style="font-family:Galatia SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">&#7984;&#967;&#952;&#973;</span>), but it must have a suffix. The root occurs in the affixed forms <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">ikhthus, ikhthuos, ikhthun, ikhthues, ikhthu&#333;n, ikhthuas</span> (<span style="font-family:Galatia SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">&#7984;&#967;&#952;&#973;&#962;, &#7984;&#967;&#952;&#973;&#959;&#962;, &#7984;&#967;&#952;&#973;&#957;, &#7984;&#967;&#952;&#973;&#949;&#962;, &#7984;&#967;&#952;&#973;&#969;&#957;, &#7984;&#967;&#952;&#973;&#945;&#962;</span>), but never by itself as a word. So it is a bound root, meaning that it must be bound to an affix. If a root can occur by
		 itself without any affixes, it is called an "unbound root" or simply a "root." In order for Language Explorer to correctly
		 parse words, it needs to know which entries are roots and which are bound roots. You specify this information in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <p>You should create an entry for each root in your language. This enables the parser to analyze your derivational morphology.
		 See section <a href="#sBoundRoots">3.1.4.1</a> for special considerations for bound roots. Language Explorer presents each root as a main entry in the published dictionary.
		 If you don't want a root to appear in your dictionary, you can exclude it using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Exclude As Headword</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sBoundRoots"></a>3.1.4.1&nbsp;Bound root
	  </h4>
	  <p>A bound root is a root that cannot occur by itself in normal speech. It always occurs bound together with an affix or another
		 root. You should create an entry for each bound root. When you create an entry for a bound root, you should type an asterisk
		 (*) at the beginning of the form. Language Explorer will treat any form that begins with an asterisk as either a bound root
		 or a bound stem.
	  </p>
	  <p>If you want the entry to be included in your published dictionary, you should decide what form of the word to use as the headword
		 in the dictionary article. You should put this form in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field. If you do not want the entry to be included in your published dictionary, you should put a check in the box in the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Exclude As Headword</span> field. In the following example the asterisk indicates that the headword is a bound root and does not occur naturally in
		 the language.
	  </p>

	  <p>Most English dictionaries would not include an entry for a bound root such as this, because it never occurs by itself as a
		 word. Users would generally not be interested in such entries and would very likely be confused by them. For this reason most
		 dictionaries only use naturally occuring words as headwords.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sAffix"></a>3.1.5&nbsp;Affix
	  </h3>
	  <p>An affix is a morpheme (a part of a word) that cannot stand alone and must be attached to a root. Affixes are distinguished
		 by two primary features--where they occur in the word, and what kind of meaning they have. Prefixes occur before the root,
		 suffixes after the root, infixes in the middle of the root (sometimes in the middle of another affix), and circumfixes on
		 both ends of the root. Inflectional affixes often indicate how the word functions in the grammar, or adds a meaning such as
		 '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">Plural</span>' (for nouns) or '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">Past tense</span>' (for verbs). Derivational affixes usually change the grammatical category (part of speech) of the root or change the meaning
		 in some important way. For instance the derivational affix <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'-er</span>' changes a verb into a noun, as in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'speak/speaker</span>', and also changes the meaning from an action to a person who does the action.
	  </p>
	  <p>In order for Language Explorer to correctly parse words, it needs to know which entries are affixes and what kind of affixes
		 they are. You specify this information in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field. When you create an entry for a prefix, you should type a hyphen after it (e.g. <span style="color:#0000ff; ">un-</span>). Similarly when you create an entry for a suffix, you should type a hyphen before it (e.g. <span style="color:#0000ff; ">-ed</span>). Infixes are entered with a hyphen on either side (e.g. <span style="color:#0000ff; ">-em-</span>). Circumfixes are entered with two hyphens with a space in between (e.g. <span style="color:#0000ff; ">ka- -an</span>). This tells the program that it is an affix and what kind of affix.<span style="font-size:65%; vertical-align:super">[<a href="#nToken">5</a>]</span> Language Explorer will treat any form that begins or ends with a hyphen as an affix.
	  </p>
	  <p>You should create an entry for each affix in your language. The primary reason is so that you can interlinearize texts. But
		 it is also important to document all the morphemes in your language. Even if you don't want entries for affixes in your published
		 dictionary, it is good to include them in the database. Future generations of scholars will look at your dictionary for information
		 on how the language was spoken today.
	  </p>
	  <p>If you want the entry to be included in your published dictionary, you should decide what form of the affix to use as the
		 headword in the dictionary article. You should put this form in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field. If you do not want the entry to be included in your published dictionary, you should put a check in the box in the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Exclude As Headword</span> field. For more on affixes and how to handle them see Andy Black's 'Introduction to Parsing' under in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help-Resources</span> menu.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sInflAffixes"></a>3.1.5.1&nbsp;Inflectional affixes
	  </h4>
	  <p>You should create an entry for each inflectional affix in your language. See section <a href="#sAffix">3.1.5</a> for the reasons for doing this and for the procedure. Some lexicographers prefer to deal with inflectional affixes in the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar Sketch</span>, a table, or an appendix. However many users, especially language learners will look up an affix to find out what it means.
		 In the following three entries, the first two are inflectional affixes and the third is a derivational affix.

	  <p>Language Explorer enables you to parse on a root or stem level. Parsing on the stem level means that the parser will identify
		 inflectional affixes but ignore derivational affixes (and compounding). Parsing on the root level means that the parser will
		 also identify derivational affixes and multiple roots in compounds. To parse on the stem level you should only enter inflectional
		 affixes into the database. To parse on the root level you should also enter derivational affixes. If you enter both, the parser
		 will propose multiple analyses. To prevent this complication you must somehow eliminate the derivational affixes.<span style="font-size:65%; vertical-align:super">[<a href="#nStemParse">6</a>]</span> One requirement for parsing on the stem level is that you must enter stem "allomorphs" into the database. Technically stems
		 don't have allomorphs, only morphemes do. But in order to parse on the stem level we have to treat stems as if they were morphemes
		 in this respect. You should enter alternate forms of a stem in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Allomorph</span> section of <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit-Entry</span>. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Allomorphs</span> section is used to record alternate forms of stems as well as true allomorphs (alternate forms of morphemes).
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sStem"></a>3.1.6&nbsp;Stem
	  </h3>
	  <p>A stem is a word or part of a word that doesn't have any inflectional affixes added to it.</p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sRelBetwLexFrm"></a>3.2&nbsp;Relations between lexical forms
	  </h2>
	  <p>There are six basic kinds of relations between lexical forms: (1) morphemes and allomorphs, (2) basic forms of lexemes and
		 variants, (3) stems and inflected forms, (4) roots and complex forms, (5) homonyms, and (6) lexical relations. The first four
		 involve a relation between a basic form and another form based on it. The fifth kind, homonyms, is when two words are the
		 same in form, but unrelated in meaning. The sixth kind, lexical relations, involves a semantic relationship between lexemes.
		 Allomorphs and variants are similar in that they are alternate forms of a lexeme that are used in different environments.
		 Inflected forms and complex forms are similar in that they are composed of more than one morpheme. Once we understand these
		 six kinds of relations, we can understand many of the issues involved in structuring our data.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sAllomorphs"></a>3.2.1&nbsp;Morphemes and allomorphs
	  </h3>
	  <p>An allomorph is an alternate form of a morpheme. For instance the root <span style="color:#0000ff; ">stop</span> has the form <span style="color:#0000ff; ">stop</span> in the word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">stops</span>, and the form <span style="color:#0000ff; ">stopp</span> in the word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">stopped</span>. A morpheme sometimes only has a single form. In this case you would enter the form in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field. If a morpheme has more than one form, each form is called an allomorph. If one allomorph is more basic than the others,
		 you would put the basic form in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field. The other allomorphs should be entered in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Allomorphs</span> section of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane. Click anywhere in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Allomorphs</span> line. Then click the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Insert Allomorph</span> link. Type the form of the allomorph in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Stem Allomorph</span> field. (If the lexeme is an affix, this field will be called the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Affix Allomorph</span> field.) Use the other fields as needed. If you need to enter another allomorph, click the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Insert Allomorph</span> link again. Another bundle of allomorph fields will appear.
	  </p>
	  <p>Not all morphemes have allomorphs. But some do when something in the context causes the morpheme to change in form. Usually
		 the contextual factor is phonological, but sometimes it is due to the inflection class of a neighboring morpheme. The plural
		 suffix in English is an example of a morpheme with allomorphs. It has the form <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">-s</span> following a voiceless consonant as in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">cats</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[k&aelig;ts]</span>, <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">-z</span> following a vowel or voiced consonant as in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">dogs</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[dagz]</span>, or <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">-&#616;z</span> following a sibilant <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[s, z, &#643;, &#658;, &#679;, &#676;]</span> as in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">foxes</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[faks&#616;z]</span>. Some linguists would say that <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">-z</span> is the underlying form (even though we normally write it with an <span style="color:#0000ff; ">s</span>), since the other two allomorphs can be derived from it by simple rules. The relationship between an underlying form and
		 its allomorphs is often expressed by a rule in the form:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">

	  <p>Different theories express the rules using features, natural classes, or other theoretical devices. Currently Language Explorer
		 only supports natural classes. You define the classes in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar-Natural Classes</span> area. You define the environments in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar-Environments</span> area. Then for each allomorph you select the appropriate environment from the list of environments in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Environment</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span>. An environment can make use of a natural class, such as /_[V] (before vowels), or simply use a string of characters, such
		 as /_tion.
	  </p>
	  <p>Roots can also have allomorphs, as in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">divine</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[d&#618;va&#690;n]</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">divinity </span>(<span style="color:#0000ff; ">divine</span> + <span style="color:#0000ff; ">-ity</span>) <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[d&#618;v&#618;n&#618;ti]</span>. We can say that the allomorph <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[d&#618;va&#690;n]</span> is the underlying form, since the allomorph <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[d&#618;v&#618;n]</span> is derived by a rule that shortens a vowel when it is followed by a two syllable suffix such as <span style="color:#0000ff; ">-ity</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[-&#618;ti]</span>.
	  </p>
	  <p>Sometimes it is difficult to pick one of the allomorphs as the underlying form. For instance all four allomorphs of the <span style="color:#0000ff; ">im-/in-/ir-/il-</span> prefix in the words <span style="color:#0000ff; ">impossible</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;mpas&#618;b&#316;]</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">intangible</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;nt&aelig;n&#676;&#618;b&#316;]</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">incomplete</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;&#331;k&#477;mplit]</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">irreplaceable</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;r&#652;ples&#618;b&#316;]</span>, and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">illicit</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;l&#618;s&#618;t]</span> are formed by rules from an abstract form that we can symbolize as <span style="color:#0000ff; ">iN-</span>. We would say that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">iN-</span> is the underlying form. We would not normally put abstract forms in a published dictionary, since most people wouldn't understand
		 the symbols we use (such as using a capital letter to indicate a archiphoneme). Instead we would give the abstract form in
		 the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field, but put one of the allomorphs in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field so that it will be used as the headword in the published dictionary. We also have to indicate that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">iN-</span> is an abstract form so that the parser doesn't try to use it. We do this by putting a check in the box in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Is Abstract Form</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <p>Allomorphs are treated together in a single entry because they are merely alternate forms of the same lexeme. It is important
		 to record information about allomorphs if you want to use the parser to interlinearize texts. But most published dictionaries
		 ignore allomorphs, since the average user is not even aware of them. You can configure the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span> view to include them if you want. Some lexicographers may want to explain when allomorphs are used. There is currently no
		 field specifically devoted to a prose discussion of allomorphs, but you can set up a custom field for it and configure it
		 to be displayed in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span> view. Do not create a separate entry for an allomorph unless for some reason you want to create a minor entry for it in your
		 published dictionary. For instance if you created an entry for the prefix 'in-', you might possibly also want to create a
		 minor entry for its allomorph 'im-'. If you want an allomorph to appear in your dictionary as a minor entry, you must create
		 a separate entry for it in the database and treat it in the same way as a variant.
	  </p>
	  <p>Allomorphs are handled differently than variants. The reason for this is because allomorphs are conditioned by phonological
		 and grammatical features in the linguistic environment. The parser needs to know what these features are in order to correctly
		 parse words. In contrast variants are conditioned by pragmatic or sociolinguistic factors in the extra-linguistic environment.
		 The parser cannot access these factors. So as far as the parser is concerned variants are essentially unconditioned. Traditionally
		 variants are listed in a published dictionary, but allomorphs are not. For more on handling allomorphs see Andy Black's 'Introduction
		 to Parsing' in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help-Resources</span> menu.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sPhonOrthAllo"></a>3.2.1.1&nbsp;Phonological and orthographic allomorphs
	  </h4>
	  <p>In some languages there is a difference between phonological allomorphs and orthographic allomorphs. For instance <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'divine'</span> has two phonological allomorphs <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[d&#618;va&#690;n]</span> and <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[d&#618;v&#618;n]</span> (<span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">d&#618;v&#618;n-&#618;ti</span>) as well as two orthographic allomorphs <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'divine'</span> and '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">divin'</span> (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">divin-ity</span>). But note that the orthography does not exactly represent the phonological difference. Next compare <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'wage'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'wag-ing'</span> with <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'wag'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'wagg-ing'</span>. <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'Wage'</span> only has one phonological allomorph <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[we&#690;&#676;]</span>, but has two orthographic allomorphs <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'wage'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'wag'</span>. Likewise <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'wag'</span> has one phonological allomorph <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[w&aelig;g]</span> and two orthographic allomorphs <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'wag'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'wagg'</span>.
	  </p>
	  <p>Next consider the allomorphs of '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">iN-' '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">NEG</span>' </span>in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'impossible'</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;mpas&#618;b&#316;]</span>, '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">intangible'</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;nt&aelig;n&#676;&#618;b&#316;]</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'incomplete'</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;&#331;k&#477;mplit]</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">irreplaceable</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;r&#652;ples&#618;b&#316;]</span>, and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">illicit</span> <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;l&#618;s&#618;t]</span>. Note that there are four phonological allomorphs <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;m]</span>, <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;n]</span>, <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;&#331;]</span>, and <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;]</span>, and four orthographic allomorphs '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">im'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'in'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'ir'</span>, and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'il'</span>. This mismatch of phonological and orthographic allomorphs will be common in languages with "morphophonemic" orthographies.
	  </p>
	  <p>How do we handle this sort of complexity? For the English prefix <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'iN-'</span> we could do it this way:
	  </p>
	  <ol style="list-style-type:decimal; ">
		 <li>Put '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">iN-'</span> in the Lexeme Form field and click the Is Abstract Form field.
		 </li>
		 <li>Put <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'in'</span> in the Citation Form field. This will make <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'in-</span>' the headword in the published dictionary.
		 </li>
		 <li>In the Pronunciation section insert four pronunciations for the <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;m]</span>, <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;n]</span>, <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;&#331;]</span>, and <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">[&#618;]</span> phonological allomorphs. The Pronunciation field can be displayed in the published dictionary.
		 </li>
		 <li>In the Alternate Forms section insert four affix allomorphs for the '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">im'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'in'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'ir'</span>, and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'il'</span> orthographic allomorphs. The Alternate Forms section is used by the parser, but is not displayed in the published dictionary.
			Since the parser is analyzing orthographic words, it only deals with orthographic allomorphs, not phonological allomorphs.
		 </li>
		 <li>You might also want to create a minor entry for the <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'im'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'ir'</span>, and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'il'</span> orthographic allomorphs. You do this by clicking in the Variants section of the Entry pane. Click Insert Variant and type
			"im-" (or "ir-" or "il-") into the Variant box. Then click OK. In the Variant Type field choose Spelling Variant. Language
			Explorer will create a separate entry for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'im-</span>' in the lexicon and display it as a minor entry in the published dictionary.
		 </li>
		 <li>To avoid confusion you might want to add an entry level comment (you would have to do this with a custom field) explicitly
			state that there are four phonological allomorphs and four orthographic allomorphs, give examples of each, and state that
			there is a mismatch between the two sets. You could choose to display this field in the published dictionary.
		 </li>
	  </ol>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sAltFormStem"></a>3.2.1.2&nbsp;Alternate form of a stem
	  </h4>
	  <p>It is sometimes necessary to enter an alternate form of a stem. In linguistics an allomorph is an alternate form of a morpheme,
		 not a stem. So technically stems do not have allomorphs. But when we interlinearize a text, we often do not want to parse
		 a word all the way down to its roots. Instead we ignore derivational affixes and only analyze inflectional affixes. When we
		 do this, we often find that a stem has more than one form. For instance the word 'popularize' is composed of the root 'popul'
		 (cf. populace, population, populous), the suffix '-ar' and the suffix '-ize'. But when we interlinearize an inflected form
		 such as 'popularizing', we just want to indicate that it is composed of the stem 'popularize' and the suffix '-ing'. But the
		 form of the stem in 'popularizing' is actually 'populariz', not 'popularize'. The silent 'e' is dropped when the suffix is
		 added.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer handles alternate forms of a stem in the same way as allomorphs. You would not create a separate entry for
		 an alternate form. Instead you enter the alternate form in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Allomorphs</span> section of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane. See section <a href="#sAllomorphs">3.2.1</a> for instructions on how to do this.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sVariants"></a>3.2.2&nbsp;Lexemes and variants
	  </h3>
	  <p>A variant is an alternate form of a lexeme. A variant is like an allomorph in that both are alternate forms. But an allomorph
		 is an alternate form of a morpheme and a variant can be an alternate form of any kind of lexeme. Allomorphs are conditioned
		 by phonological or morphological factors, while variants are conditioned by a wide range of socioloinguistic factors. Consider
		 the following pairs of words:

	  <p>These are all examples of various kinds of variants. Example <a href="#xColor">(11)</a> is a spelling variant between American and British English. Although the word is pronounced differently in the two dialects,
		 the difference is regular. So this would not be considered an example of a pronunciation variant. To be a pronunciation variant
		 the difference would have to be irregular.
	  </p>
	  <p>Example <a href="#xArent">(12)</a> is a dialect variant, which in this case is also both a pronunciation variant and a spelling variant between standard English
		 and Southern American English.
	  </p>
	  <p>Example <a href="#xEither">(13)</a> is a social variant, which means that it is a pronunciation variant determined by social class.
	  </p>
	  <p>Example <a href="#xInteresting">(14)</a> is a register variant. The word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'interesting'</span> can be pronounced <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'intresting'</span> in informal speech and pronounced <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'ineresting'</span> in fast speech. We call variants like these 'register variants' because they are used in different registers such as formal
		 speech versus informal speech, slow speech versus fast speech, and oral versus written expression.
	  </p>
	  <p>Example <a href="#xData">(15)</a> is a free variant, which means it is a pronunciation variant that is unconditioned. Most &#8220;free&#8221; variants are actually conditioned,
		 but the factors may be difficult to determine. So they appear to be unconditioned.
	  </p>
	  <p>Example <a href="#xLift">(16)</a> is a dialect variant between British and American English in which a different lexeme is used. (See below for how to handle
		 this situation.)
	  </p>
	  <p>Variants are irregular forms of a lexeme that are conditioned by pragmatic or sociological factors. The first thing you must
		 do is determine which form of the lexeme is the normal or basic form. The headword of a dictionary article stands for all
		 the variants.

	  <p>You handle variants by first creating an entry for the primary form. Then you enter the variant in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section toward the bottom of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> view. You specify the type of variant in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Type</span> field. The variant type is chosen from a list. Since there are many types of variants, Language Explorer allows you to add
		 your own variant types to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Types</span> list in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area. For instance you can set up a variant type for a specific dialect.
	  </p>
	  <p>When you add a variant, Language Explorer automatically creates a separate entry for it. There are several reasons for this.
		 One reason is that the parser needs to know how to handle the form. If the variant has allomorphs or belongs to a different
		 inflection class, you would indicate this in the entry for the variant. You may also want to display the variant as a minor
		 entry in the published dictionary. If you choose to display a variant as a minor entry, you may want to include information
		 of various kinds, such as how the variant is pronounced, or give an example sentence to indicate how the variant is used.
		 In order for the program to be able to do these things, it is necessary for variants to be separate entries in the database.
		 You can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Dictionary</span> feature under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools</span> menu to specify what fields you want to include in minor entries in the published dictionary.
	  </p>
	  <p>Example <a href="#xLift">(16)</a> cannot be handled in this way because it is not really a variant. A variant is an alternate form of the same lexeme. But
		 '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">lift</span>' and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'elevator'</span> are different lexemes. The relation between them is actually more similar to that of synonyms, except that in this case one
		 word is British and the other American. Another difference is that this kind of link can be between senses of a lexeme. In
		 the case of '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">lift</span>' and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'elevator'</span> each lexeme has other senses. Only one sense of each lexeme is involved in the variant relation. So rather than call these
		 'variants', we call them 'dialect synonyms'.
	  </p>
	  <p>You have to handle dialect synonyms in the same way as you would regular synonyms using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field on the sense level. You should create a new lexical relation in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists--Lexical Relations</span> area. In the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reference set type</span> field specify that it is an <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry/Sense Pair - 2 relation names</span>. This allows you to give an abbreviation and reverse abbreviation for the cross-references in the two entries. If I was producing
		 a dictionary in which British English was the primary dialect, I would give 'American dialect synonym' in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Name</span> field, and give 'Am. var. of' as the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Abbreviation</span>. I would give 'British dialect synonym' as the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reverse Name</span> and 'Am. var.' as the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reverse Abbreviation</span>. Then in the entry for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'lift'</span> in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field I would select <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Insert British dialect synonym Relation (to this American dialect synonym)</span> from the list of choices. In the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Add Reference</span> dialog box I would type '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">elevator</span>' in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Find</span> box, click <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Choose a sense of the entry</span>, then select the correct sense. The program will then add the appropriate cross-reference to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span> view of each entry.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sInflectedForms"></a>3.2.3&nbsp;Stems and inflected forms
	  </h3>
	  <p>An inflected form is composed of a stem and one or more inflectional affixes. Consider the following set of words:</p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">

	  </div>
	  <p>Each of them is a well-formed, natural English word that you might encounter in speech or in writing. If we were to make each

	  <p>What is the problem with a dictionary like this? Most people would recognize that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'deeds'</span> is the plural of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'deed</span>'. In fact many people might say something like, &#8220;Deed and deeds are really the same word. Deeds is just the plural of deed.&#8221;
		 (In lexicography we would say they are the same 'lexeme', but most people think of them as the same 'word'.) What they mean
		 by this is that they don&#8217;t think of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'deed'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'deeds'</span> as two different words, but as two forms of the same underlying word (lexeme). Similarly most people think of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'does'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'doing'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'did'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'done'</span> as forms of the word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'do'</span>. Likewise <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'redoes'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'redoing'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'redid'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'redone'</span> are forms of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'redo</span>'. However <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'doable'</span> has no alternate forms. It is all by itself.
	  </p>
	  <p>Another problem is that a dictionary like the one above would be huge. Every verb in English potentially has five different
		 forms (stem, past tense, past participle, present participle, third person singular present tense) and every noun has two
		 forms (singular and plural). If we included all these forms, we would almost triple the size of the dictionary. To print such
		 a book would be much more expensive.
	  </p>
	  <p>This is a much greater problem for languages with many affixes. English only has five different verb forms, but some languages
		 have thousands. It would be very expensive, if not impossible, to include every single possible word in the dictionary.
	  </p>
	  <p>To solve these problems we must distinguish between a lexeme and all the inflected forms of the lexeme. Language explorer
		 uses the terms 'word' and 'wordform' synonymously to refer to any well-formed, naturally occurring word, including all inflected
		 forms. Each of the words in example <a href="#">()</a> is a wordform. But to save space only the following are made into entries:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xDoEntries">(19)</a></td>
			   <td>
				  <div>do, deed, doable, redo</div>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>Language Explorer keeps track of each wordform that it encounters in your text corpus and makes a list of them. This list
		 is called the &#8216;wordform inventory&#8217;. The program does this automatically. There are three views of the wordform inventory in
		 the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts &amp; Words-Word List Concordance</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word Analyses</span>, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Wordforms</span> panes. Language Explorer also keeps a list of dictionary entries in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon</span> pane. However you must tell the program which wordforms you want to make into dictionary entries. To see the difference in
		 the two lists compare the following:

	  <p>Although there are exceptions, most dictionaries do not include inflected forms as dictionary entries. Instead each inflected
		 form is combined with the headword into a single entry. So each dictionary entry represents not just the headword, but all
		 the inflected forms as well. You can think of the headword as the representative of all the inflected forms. In a language
		 like English we can give the stem as the headword and leave out the inflected forms.
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">

	  <p>Sometimes we may want to give some of the inflected wordforms in the dictionary entry, especially if they are irregular or
		 unpredictable. The English words 'did' and 'done' are irregular. So we could list the irregular inflected forms in the entry:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">

		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>But in some languages all the forms of a word have inflectional affixes. In these languages the headword must be an inflected
		 form. For instance the Swahili (a Bantu language spoken in Kenya and Tanzania) word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'mti</span>' &#8216;tree&#8217; is formed from the singular prefix <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'m-'</span> and the bound root <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'ti</span>'. The plural is <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'miti</span>'. So in the dictionary entry the headword is <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'mti'</span>, an inflected word form:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xMtiEntry">(23)</a></td>

						   </div>
						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>In Swahili a word starting with the singular prefix '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">m-</span>' could have a plural <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'miti'</span> or <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'bati</span>'. So we need to indicate the plural form in the entry:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xMtiWithInfForms">(24)</a></td>
			   <td>
				  <table>
					 <tr>
						<td>
						   <div style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; text-indent:-.4in; padding-left:.4in; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">mti</span> <span style="font-style:italic; ">N</span>. <span style="font-style:italic; ">pl:</span> <span style="font-weight:bold; ">miti</span> tree.
						   </div>
						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>From these examples you can see that (1) the headword is just one of the wordforms, (2) we pick one wordform to represent
		 the rest, (3) we may or may not list the other wordforms in the entry.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sIrregInflForms"></a>3.2.3.1&nbsp;Irregularly inflected forms
	  </h4>
	  <p>Consider the following irregularly inflected verbs:</p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xHave">(25)</a></td>
			   <td>
				  <table cellpadding="0pt" cellspacing="0pt">
					 <tr>
						<td><span style="color:#0000ff; ">have, has, having, had</span></td>

	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in; margin-top:.2in">

			   <td valign="top"><a name="xGo">(26)</a></td>
			   <td>
				  <table cellpadding="0pt" cellspacing="0pt">
					 <tr>
						<td><span style="color:#0000ff; ">go, goes, going, gone, went</span></td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>In example <a href="#xHave">(25)</a> the third singular <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'has'</span> and past tense form <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'had'</span> are irregular. It might be possible to say that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'have'</span> has an allomorph <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'ha'</span>, and analyze <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'has'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'had'</span> as <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'ha-s'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'ha-d</span>'. But since no English verb ends in '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">a</span>', this analysis violates a rule. In addition the suffix <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'-ed'</span> is spelled <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'ed'</span>, not <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'d'</span>, when it follows a vowel other than <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'e'</span> (e.g. <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'soloed</span>'). It is better to analyze <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'has'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'had'</span> as single portmanteau morphemes (a single form with two components of meaning that are normally handled by separate morphemes)
		 and gloss them as <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'have.3S'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'have.PST'</span> respectively.
	  </p>
	  <p>We handle this in Language Explorer in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane. An irregularly inflected form is not a variant. But since they are handled in a dictionary in similar ways, we handle
		 them in Language Explorer together. Each irregularly inflected form should be added to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section. In the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Type</span> field you should choose the type of variant from the list. You can set up a new variant type in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists--Variant Types</span> pane. For instance for irregular past tense verbs in English I would set up a new variant type and call it "Irregular Past
		 Tense". I would give "irreg. past tense of" in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Abbreviation</span> field and "irreg. past tense" in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reverse Abbr.</span> field. Language Explorer will automatically create a new entry for each irregularly inflected form. It will also create a
		 minor entry for each one in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span> view. (You can change this display feature if you want.) The parser will also treat irregularly inflected forms such as <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'has'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'had</span>' as single morphemes and gloss them correctly. However the gloss will be taken from the entry for the irregularly inflected
		 form, not from the primary entry. This is not ideal, but is the way Language Explorer currently works.
	  </p>
	  <p>In example <a href="#xGo">(26)</a> the past tense <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'went'</span> is not only irregular, it is based on a different root. The technical term for this is 'suppletion'. Historically we know
		 that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'went</span>' was the past tense of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'wend'</span>. Today the past tense of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'wend'</span> is <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'wended'</span>, and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'went'</span> is used as the past tense of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'go'</span>. In Language Explorer we handle this in the same way as other irregularly inflected forms by adding <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'went'</span> in the Variants section of the entry for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'go'</span>. Language Explorer automatically creates a separate entry for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'went'</span>. In the entry for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'went'</span> you can give a gloss or provide other information such as the etymology.
	  </p>
	  <p>There are three primary reasons why Language Explorer creates a separate entry for variants and irregularly inflected forms.
		 The first is that it is difficult to get the parser to analyze them correctly in any other way. The second is that we often
		 want to create a minor entry for them in a published dictionary. The third is that we often need to record other information
		 about them such as pronunciation, variants, etymology, usage, example sentences, etc. Even though variants and irregularly
		 inflected forms are not separate lexemes, for these practical reasons it is best to handle them in separate entries in the
		 database.

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sComplexForms"></a>3.2.4&nbsp;Complex forms
	  </h3>
	  <p>A complex form is a lexeme composed of two or more morphemes. Consider the following set of words:</p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xPeace">(27)</a></td>
			   <td>
				  <table cellpadding="0pt" cellspacing="0pt">
					 <tr>
						<td><span style="color:#0000ff; ">peace, peaceful, pacify, pacifist, Pacific, pacification, peacetime, peace-keeping, peace-loving, peace treaty, keep the peace,
							  be at peace with</span></td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>We recognize that each of them is based on the word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'peace</span>'. For instance <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pacification</span>' is a combination of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'peace'</span> and the derivational affixes <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'&#8211;ify'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'-ic</span>', and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'-ation</span>'. The word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'peacetime</span>' is composed of the words <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'peace</span>' and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'time</span>'. The phrase <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'make peace'</span> is a combination of the words <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'make'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'peace'</span>. But <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'peace'</span> itself is not based on any other word and cannot be divided into morphemes.
	  </p>
	  <p>The technical term for a word that is not based on any other word and cannot be divided into morphemes is 'root'. The word
		 <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'peace'</span> is a root. A complex form must contain at least one root.
	  </p>
	  <p>The technical term for a word composed of a root and one or more derivational affixes is 'derivative'. The words '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">peaceful'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pacify'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pacifist</span>', <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pacification'</span>, and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'Pacific'</span> are derivatives.
	  </p>
	  <p>The technical term for a word composed of two or more roots (or stems) is 'compound'. The words <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'peacetime'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'peace-keeping'</span>, and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'peace-loving'</span> are compounds. Notice that the hyphen is used in the English orthography to divide some compounds but not others.
	  </p>
	  <p>The technical term for a lexeme composed of two or more words is 'lexical phrase' (or sometimes 'phrasal lexeme'). The phrases
		 <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'peace treaty</span>', <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'keep the peace'</span>, and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'</span><span style="color:#0000ff; "><span style="color:#0000ff; ">be at peace</span> with</span>' are lexical phrases. So there are three basic kinds of complex forms&#8212;derivative, compound, and lexical phrase. You will
		 also see the technical term 'multiword expression', often abbreviated MWE. But this is a more general term for any construction
		 composed of two or more words, including lexical phrases, greetings, proverbs, and common collocates.
	  </p>
	  <p>Notice that there is a mismatch between the category 'stem' and the category 'complex form'. A complex form can be a derivative,
		 compound, or phrase. The category stem is limited to single words.

	  <h4 style=""><a name="sContractions"></a>3.2.4.1&nbsp;Contractions
	  </h4>
	  <p>A contraction is a combination of two lexemes, each of which maintains its own meaning. For instance <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'hasn't'</span>' is a combination of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'has'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'not'</span>.
	  </p>
	  <p>Contractions are different from compounds. A compound, such as <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'hasbeen'</span>, is a combination of two lexemes with an unpredictable change in meaning. There is no such change in meaning in a contraction.
	  </p>
	  <p>Contractions are different from clitics. A clitic is a lexeme that is grammatically independent but attaches phonologically
		 to any adjacent word. An example of a clitic is the English possessive <span style="color:#0000ff; ">&#8211;&#8217;s</span> in the phrases <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'Elizabeth's hat'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'the queen&#8217;s hat'</span>, and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'the queen of England's hat'</span>. The clitic <span style="color:#0000ff; ">&#8211;'s</span> obligatorily attaches to whatever noun precedes it. In contrast a contraction is a specific pair of words that regularly
		 combines. The combination may be obligatory, as in the case of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'let's'</span>, as in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">"Let's go"</span> (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">"Let us go"</span> has a different meaning), or it may be optional, as in the case of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'we've'</span>, as in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">"We've been honored,"</span> or <span style="color:#0000ff; ">"We have been honored."</span></p>
	  <p>Contractions are different from portmanteau morphemes. A portmanteau morpheme is a single, indivisible morpheme that combines
		 two meanings that are usually expressed by separate morphemes. An example of a portmanteau morpheme is the word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'were'</span> which is a single morpheme expressing the meaning of the lexeme <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'be'</span> and the grammatical category <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#00cc00; ">'Past.tense'</span>. <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'Were'</span> cannot be divided into two morphemes. (Note that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'busted'</span> can be divided into <span style="color:#0000ff; ">bust-ed</span> <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#00cc00; ">'bust-Past.tense'</span>.) In contrast the contraction <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'we're'</span> (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">we are</span>) can be divided into <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'we-'re'</span>.
	  </p>
	  <p>One or both members of a contraction can be shortened. Most English contractions only shorten the second member, as in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'I'm'</span> (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">I am</span>), <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'it's'</span> (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">it is</span>), <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'isn't'</span> (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">is not</span>). Others shorten both members, as in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'won't'</span> (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">will not</span>), <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'shan't'</span> (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">shall not</span>), <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'ain't'</span> (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">am not</span>).
	  </p>
	  <p>A contraction can combine more than two members, as in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'wouldn't've'</span> (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">would not have</span>).
	  </p>
	  <p>English orthography uses the apostrophe to indicate the loss of a phoneme, as in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'shouldn't'</span> (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">should not</span>). But when both words lose a phoneme, only one apostrophe is used, as in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'shan't'</span> (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">shall not</span>). In writing sometimes a contraction is written out as two separate words, even when it would normally be shortened to the
		 contracted form in speech. Other languages may or may not choose to follow these orthographic conventions.

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sHomonyms"></a>3.2.5&nbsp;Homonyms

	  </div>
	  <p>The first meaning of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'bear'</span> comes from an old root meaning '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">brown</span>'. The second entry has three meanings, all of which come from an old root meaning '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">carry</span>'. Since all three meanings of the second entry are related and come from the same root, we put them together in the same
		 entry. But since <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'bear</span>' (large mammal) and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'bear</span>' (carry) are unrelated in meaning, we keep them separate. In Language Explorer you would create separate entries in the lexicon
		 for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'bear'</span> (large mammal) and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'bear'</span> (carry). You would create three senses in the entry for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'bear'</span> (carry), one for each meaning. The program automatically supplies the homonym numbers and sense numbers.
	  </p>
	  <p>There are two kinds of homonyms. If two words are spelled the same, we call them homographs. If two words are pronounced the
		 same, we call them homophones. <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'Bear</span>' (large mammal) and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'bear'</span> (carry) are both homographs and homophones, since they are spelled and pronounced the same. The English words <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'sow'</span> [<span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">so</span>] '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">to plant seeds</span>' and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'sow'</span> [<span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">saw</span>] '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">female pig</span>' are homographs, but not homophones, since they are spelled the same, but pronounced differently. The words <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'sow</span>' [<span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">so</span>] '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">to plant seeds</span>' and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'sew</span>' [<span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">so</span>] '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">to join pieces of cloth using needle and thread</span>' are homophones, but not homographs, since they are pronounced the same, but spelled differently. You should create separate
		 entries for both kinds of homonyms.
	  </p>
	  <p>Some dictionaries do not distinguish homonyms and choose instead to combine them in a single entry. The reason for doing this
		 is that most users are not aware of the etymology of words and therefore do not understand the reason for separating a single
		 form such as <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'bear'</span> into two entries. They would rather just search a single entry for the meaning that they are interested in. It is also sometimes
		 hard for a lexicographer to distinguish homonyms without doing a lot of careful historical research. You are free to separate
		 homonyms into separate entries or combine them in a single entry. There are three primary reasons for separating homonyms.
		 The first is that dictionaries have traditionally separated them and users may expect all the senses in an entry to be somehow
		 related. The second reason is so that you can provide etymological information for each. The third reason is so that you can
		 provide information that may be different between the two homonyms. For instance English dictionaries indicate the inflected
		 forms of irregular verbs. Sometimes homonyms belong in two different inflection classes and you have to create two entries
		 so that you can indicate how each is inflected:

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sLexRel"></a>3.2.6&nbsp;Lexical relations
	  </h3>
	  <p>We have been discussing relations between lexical forms. But some lexemes are related not by form but by meaning. These meaning-based
		 relationships are called "lexical relations."
	  </p>
	  <p>Some lexicographers wish to indicate all the lexical relations that exist in the lexicon. Such a task would be enormous, since
		 the entire lexicon is related in a giant web of relationships. These relationships are of many types. Some are regular and
		 easy to understand, while others are very complex and unique. Lexicographers have developed lists of some of the more regular
		 and frequent lexical relations. We do not have space here to describe them all. The following are a few of the most commonly
		 used lexical relations:
	  </p>
	  <ol style="list-style-type:decimal; ">
		 <li>Synonym. The meanings of X and Y are very similar (e.g. big:large).</li>
		 <li>Antonym. The meanings of X and Y are opposites on a scale, or one aspect of the meaning is negated in one of the lexemes (e.g.
			big:little).
		 </li>
		 <li>Generic:Specific. X is a generic term and Y is a specific kind of X (e.g. tool:hammer).</li>
		 <li>Whole:Part. X is a thing and Y is a part of X (e.g. body:head).</li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>You can add to the list of lexical relations in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists--Lexical Relations</span> pane. So you can customize the list to suit your needs.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field was designed to enable you to link two entries (or particular senses of two entries) and choose the particular lexical
		 relation that exists between them. Go to one of the entries and find the relevant sense. Click the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field and then click the blue arrow on the left of the line. Select the appropriate lexical relation from the list. Then
		 in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Add Reference</span> dialog box select the sense of the other entry.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can create a link between two senses from either entry. You only need to create the link once. You don't have to do it
		 in both entries. Language Explorer automatically creates a cross-reference in each entry in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span> View.
	  </p>
	  <p>Since you are relating meanings, you should link the relevant sense of one entry to the relevant sense of the other entry.
		 You will find that many words have other meanings that will not be relevant to the lexical relation. So I recommend that you
		 always specify the sense of the other entry. For instance the noun 'tool' is related to the noun 'hammer' by the generic:specific
		 lexical relation. But both 'tool' and 'hammer' have other meanings as nouns and both can be used as verbs. So only one sense
		 of 'tool' and one sense of 'hammer' are related by the generic:specific lexical relation.
	  </p>
	  <p>If you wish to create a cross-reference between two lexemes on the entry level, you can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Cross References</span> field. However you should use caution when using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Cross References</span> field. If two entries are related on the entry level, they are most likely related in form, one being a complex form and
		 the other a root. In such cases you should link them using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Forms</span> field. If two entries are not related by form, but by meaning, it is better to use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field to link the relevant senses.
	  </p>
	  <p>Both the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Cross References</span> field create a link between two entries (or senses). This ensures that both entries exist and that the spelling of the headword
		 and reference are the same. You can also refer to another entry from within a field. For instance you could use a vernacular
		 word in a definition. However such a reference is not a link, so there is no guarantee that the other entry exists or that
		 the headword of the other entry is spelled the same as the reference. So whenever possible you should use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sDistinctions"></a>3.3&nbsp;Important distinctions
	  </h2>
	  <p>Understanding the following distinctions will help you understand how Language Explorer functions.</p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sWordVSMorph"></a>3.3.1&nbsp;Word versus morpheme
	  </h3>
	  <p>Words are composed of morphemes. A morpheme can be a root or an affix. Affixes like <span style="color:#0000ff; ">-s</span> cannot stand alone as an independent word, but roots like <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'dog'</span> can. So a word can consist of a single root. An affix is never a word. (A clitic is a special kind of morpheme that acts
		 like a word syntactically, but like an affix morphologically and phonologically. An example of a clitic is the form of the
		 verb <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'be'</span> in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'I'm'</span>.) When we parse words, we divide them into morphemes. Inflected words are composed of morphemes. They are composed of a stem
		 and at least one inflectional affix. Derivatives, compounds, and phrases are also composed of morphemes. Derivatives are words
		 composed of a root and at least one derivational affix. Compounds are words composed of at least two roots and sometimes one
		 or more derivational affixes. Phrases are composed of two or more words. So the terms 'word' and 'morpheme' do not refer to
		 the same set of things:

	  </div>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sLexVsEntry"></a>3.3.2&nbsp;Lexeme versus entry
	  </h3>
	  <p>The terms 'lexeme' and 'entry' both refer to the same basic thing, except that a lexeme is a unit in the mental lexicon and
		 an entry is a unit in a database or published dictionary. Both refer to the abstract unit underlying a set of inflected forms
		 such as <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'stop</span>', <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'stops'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'stopping'</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'stopped'</span>. This abstract unit is a combination of a phonological form, a set of grammatical rules governing its use, and one or more
		 meanings. There are a few differences between them. A lexeme only contains information that a person has in his mind. An entry
		 in a database may contain other information such as the etymology of the word.
	  </p>
	  <p>Some lexicographers use the term 'lexeme' to refer to the combination of a form and a single meaning. In the literature on
		 lexicography you will sometimes encounter other terms that refer to the same basic unit as a lexeme or entry. An entry in
		 a database is sometimes called a 'lexical entry' to distinguish it from entries in other kinds of databases. The general term
		 for an entry in a database is 'record'. (Each part of a record is called a 'field'.) An entry in a published dictionary is
		 sometimes called an 'article'. We also talk about 'main entries', 'subentries', and 'minor entries' in a dictionary. Since
		 the term 'entry' is used for both an entry in the database and an article in the dictionary, Language Explorer follows this
		 tradition and uses 'entry' for both.

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sLexVSCF"></a>3.3.3&nbsp;Lexeme form versus citation form

	  <p>A problem sometimes occurs in inflected languages when the stem of a word never occurs by itself in speech. Consider the following

	  <p>The problem with <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'d&#333;'</span> is that it never occurs by itself. It is always inflected (although the infinitive <span style="font-family:Galatia SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">&#948;&#8183;</span> is very close to <span style="font-family:Galatia SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">&#948;&#969;</span>). The first form <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'did&#333;mi</span>' (<span style="font-family:Galatia SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">&#948;&#943;&#948;&#969;&#956;&#953;</span>) is the present tense first person singular. The root is <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'d&#333;'</span>, <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'di-'</span> is an inflectional prefix meaning '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">Present</span>', and <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'-mi'</span> is an inflectional suffix meaning '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">1st person singular</span>'.
	  </p>
	  <p>We need to choose some form of <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'d&#333;</span>' as the headword in the entry. But experience has shown that people usually have trouble finding the root of a word if it
		 never occurs by itself. So it is best to pick a form of the word that actually occurs in speech. Therefore the bound form
		 <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'d&#333;'</span> is not a good choice. Greek dictionaries traditionally use the present tense first person singular form of verbs as the headword.
		 So <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'d&#333;'</span> would be listed under <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'did&#333;mi'</span> rather than <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'d&#333;'</span>. This is called the citation form. The citation form is that form of a word that is used to begin the dictionary article.
		 A traditional dictionary is organized by alphabetizing the citation forms. The uninflected stem is called the lexeme form.
		 In our example <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'d&#333;'</span> is the lexeme form and <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'did&#333;mi'</span> is the citation form.

	  <p>But there is a problem. Each of the forms of <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'d&#333;</span>' listed above would alphabetize in a different place. If someone looked up <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'ed&#333;ka'</span>, he would look for it in the 'E' section and wouldn't find it. So he has to know what form the word is listed under. The
		 important principle is to remember that people have to find the entry. Whatever form we pick as the citation form, people
		 have to be able to find it. If someone wants to find the entry for <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'ed&#333;ka'</span>, where will he look? You need to test your users to determine if they can find the entry for a word. Sometimes children are
		 taught in school how to use a dictionary. But if you are publishing the first dictionary in your language, this may not help.
		 The strategy for finding a word in one language will be different from the strategy required for another language.

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sLeVSCiVSHe"></a>3.3.4&nbsp;Lexeme form versus citation form versus headword
	  </h3>
	  <p>In a language like Greek some words are inflected and others are not. In the previous section we saw that the bound stem (lexeme
		 form) <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'d&#333;'</span> is not used as the headword in a published dictionary. Instead an inflected form <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'did&#333;mi</span>' is used. In contrast the Greek word <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'kai'</span> '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">and</span>' is not inflected. The lexeme form is <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">'kai</span>' and it is used as the headword. So in some situations the (uninflected) lexeme form is used as the headword and in other
		 situations the (inflected) citation form is used as the headword. So the terms citation form and headword are not exactly
		 synonymous.
	  </p>
	  <p>In Language Explorer there is a field for the lexeme form and a second field for the citation form. You would only use the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field when it is needed. If your language does not have inflectional affixes, you would not need to use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field because the lexeme form can always be used as the headword. In many languages such as Greek, sometimes the lexeme form
		 can be used as the headword and sometimes the citation form is used. If the lexeme form is used as the headword, you can leave
		 the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field blank.
	  </p>
	  <p>Some lexicographers only want to use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field when it is different from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field. If the two are the same, they want to leave the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field empty. The reason for this is so that changes to the spelling of the lexeme only have to be made once. Other lexicographers
		 prefer to fill in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field for each entry. This makes it possible to sort or filter the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field. The choice is up to you.
	  </p>
	  <p>In browse view you often want to sort on the headword. Language Explorer displays a "virtual" <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field in the browse views to enable you to sort on the headword. If there is something in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field, it is used as the headword. Otherwise the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field is used. You cannot edit the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field, since it is a virtual field. If you want to edit the headword, you must edit the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field or the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field. Language Explorer generates the headword in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span> view in the same way, by using the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field or, if there is nothing in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field, by using the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field. The following screen shot shows three entries. In the first and third entries the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> is taken from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field. In the middle entry, which has nothing in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field, the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> is taken from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field.

			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xPressPressurize">(37)</a></td>

					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>Both sets represent the inflected forms of the first word in the set. But notice that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pressurize'</span> is a derivative of '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">press'</span>. When we talk about inflected forms, we want to be able to distinguish between an inflected form and an uninflected form.
		 The technical term for an uninflected form is 'stem'. So in our examples both <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'press'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pressurize'</span> are stems. <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'Press'</span> is an underived stem and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pressurize'</span> is a derived stem.
	  </p>
	  <p>Similarly, when we talk about derived forms, we want to be able to distinguish between a derived form and an underived form.
		 The technical term for an underived form is 'root'. A stem is a form without any inflectional affixes. A root is a form without
		 any derivational affixes. In our examples only '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">press'</span> is a root. So <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'press'</span> is both a root and a stem. In contrast <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pressurize</span>' is a stem, but not a root. We would say that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pressurize'</span> is the stem of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pressurized'</span>. We would say that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'press'</span> is the root of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pressurize'</span>.
	  </p>
	  <p>A stem can be a root, derivative, or compound.</p>

	  </div>
	  <p>If a stem can occur by itself as a full word, we call it an 'unbound stem'. If it must occur with an affix, we call it a 'bound
		 stem'. This is parallel to bound and unbound roots.
	  </p>
	  <p>English has very few roots that cannot also be words. The root <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pant'</span> (noun) is one. It occurs in the plural form <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pants'</span> and in some compound words such as <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pant leg'</span> (written as two words) and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pantdress</span>'. But it never occurs by itself as a word. So <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'pant</span>' is a bound root. This shows that the terms 'root' and 'word' do not mean the same thing. A root is a part of a word. A root
		 can be a word, but isn't necessarily. A root that cannot be a word is called a bound root. A root that can be a word is called
		 an unbound root.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer needs to know which entries are roots and which are stems in order to parse words correctly. You indicate
		 this in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sTypesOfEntries"></a>3.4&nbsp;Types of entries in a published dictionary
	  </h2>
	  <p>Dictionary makers over the years have developed a tradition of four types of entries for published dictionaries--main entry,
		 subentry, minor entry, and minor subentry<span style="font-size:65%; vertical-align:super">[<a href="#nMinorSubentry">7</a>]</span>. We will discuss each of these and what they are normally used for. We will also discuss various ways in which lexeme forms
		 can be cross-referenced.
	  </p>
	  <p>The reason why we need different kinds of entries is that there are different kinds of lexemes and various kinds of forms.
		 We have seen that there are several types of lexemes&#8212;morphemes such as roots and affixes, and complex forms such as derivatives,
		 compounds, and lexical phrases. In addition some morphemes have allomorphs, some lexemes have variants, and some lexemes have
		 irregularly inflected forms. All of these need to be entered in the lexicon in some way. Each kind of form is related to other
		 forms in a variety of ways. (For instance a compound is composed of two or more roots.) There are various ways of entering
		 forms into the lexicon, various ways to indicate how they are related, and various ways of presenting them in a published
		 dictionary.
	  </p>
	  <p>The primary way to enter a form into the lexicon is to create an entry for it. However not all forms require a separate entry.
		 Language Explorer requires you to create entries for all lexemes (morphemes and complex forms). You enter variants and irregularly
		 inflected forms in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section of the primary entry. Language Explorer automatically creates a separate entry for variants and irregularly inflected
		 forms in case you need to give additional information about their meaning or usage. Allomorphs are entered in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Allomorphs</span> section of the primary entry. Regularly inflected forms are usually ignored in a dictionary, but are sometimes entered in
		 a custom field.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer makes some assumptions about how each type of form should be handled in a printed dictionary. The first
		 major assumption is that forms fall into three major groups--morphemes, complex forms, and variant forms (including irregularly
		 inflected forms). These three groups are handled differently as we will see.
	  </p>
	  <p>In this discussion we must keep one point firmly in mind. A computer can record data in one format and print (or otherwise
		 export) the same data in another format. So we must distinguish between the way we enter data, and the way the data will be
		 presented in print. Language Explorer requires that each morpheme, complex form, and variant be a separate entry in the database.
		 However the program allows entries to be printed in various ways. Just because a form is entered into the database in one
		 way does not mean it must be printed the same way. In this section we will discuss the ways in which data must be entered
		 and the ways in which it can be printed. You can choose how a particular type of entry will be presented in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span> view. Morphemes are always presented as main entries. You can set up different kinds of complex forms in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists--Complex Form Types</span> area. You can set up different kinds of variants in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists--Variant Types</span> area. You specify how an entry is formatted by going to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon</span> area and using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Dictionary</span> tool under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools</span> menu. For more on data versus presentation see section <a href="#sDataVsPresent">2.2.3</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sMainEntry"></a>3.4.1&nbsp;Main entry
	  </h3>
	  <p>The term 'main entry' refers to a type of entry in a printed dictionary. An entry in a computer database is sometimes called
		 a 'record', but in Language Explorer it is called an 'entry'. We must carefully distinguish between an 'entry' in the database
		 and a 'main entry' in a printed dictionary. The two are not necessarily the same. A main entry is a normal full entry for
		 a lexeme. A main entry alphabetizes under its headword.
	  </p>
	  <p>In Language Explorer roots are entered in the database as entries. They are always presented in a printed dictionary as main
		 entries. If affixes are included in the dictionary, they are also entered as entries and presented as main entries. The following
		 example shows how the root 'man' would be presented as a main entry:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xMEman">(39)</a></td>

						   </div>
						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>Complex forms are also entered in the database as entries. They can be printed as main entries, but as we will see below,
		 they can also be printed as subentries. Variants and irregularly inflected forms are usually not printed as main entries,
		 but in certain cases can be. The following example shows how the idiom 'make peace' would be presented as a main entry:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sSubentry"></a>3.4.2&nbsp;Subentry
	  </h3>
	  <p>A subentry is a kind of entry in a printed dictionary. It is a normal full entry that is subordinated under a main entry and
		 indented. Subentries are used for complex forms in order to physically place them with the root (or roots) that they are composed
		 of. For instance in the example below 'make peace' has been subordinated as a subentry under the entry for 'peace'. Otherwise
		 it would alphabetize under 'M'.

	  <p>A root dictionary is composed of main entries for each root with all complex forms presented as subentries under their roots.
		 If you wish to create a root dictionary, you would create entries in the database for each root and complex form, but present
		 each complex form as a subentry under the root. Some language families, most notably Afro-Asiatic, have a tradition of making
		 root dictionaries. For more on root dictionaries see section <a href="#sRDVSSD">3.5.2</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can configure your dictionary as a root dictionary using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Dictionary</span> tool in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools</span> menu.

	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sMinorEntry"></a>3.4.3&nbsp;Minor entry
	  </h3>
	  <p>A minor entry is a type of entry in a printed dictionary. It is a short entry used to help the user find a main entry. Minor
		 entries are used for variants and irregularly inflected forms. They can also be used for complex forms in a root dictionary.
		 If the user is not familiar with the language, he may not know where to find a form. For instance he might not know that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">men</span> is the plural of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">man</span>. If he looks under <span style="color:#0000ff; ">men</span>, he will not find the entry he is looking for unless you put in a minor entry for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">men</span>. The following is a minor entry for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">men</span> that directs the user to the entry <span style="color:#0000ff; ">man</span> where he will find a description of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">man</span> and its plural <span style="color:#0000ff; ">men</span>.

	  <p>This is the normal way of handling variants and irregularly inflected forms. The basic form is presented as a main entry.
		 The variant is noted as a cross-reference at the beginning of the entry and also presented as a minor entry. This is perfectly
		 acceptable practice as long as one form is more basic than the other and as long as there is no need to describe the difference
		 between the variants.
	  </p>
	  <p>However there are situations in which both forms should be treated equally. For instance you might want to treat both the
		 American and British dialects of English equally. In this case neither <span style="color:#0000ff; ">color</span> nor <span style="color:#0000ff; ">colour</span> is basic. So both are presented as main entries with a cross-reference to the other form at the beginning of each entry:

	  <p>Language Explorer is designed to enable you to maintain one lexical database, but produce more than one type of dictionary.</p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sMorphDict"></a>3.5.1&nbsp;Morpheme dictionaries
	  </h3>
	  <p>Some lexicographers want to produce a dictionary that only includes morphemes (roots and affixes). Such a dictionary is sufficient
		 for limited purposes, such as parsing isolated words down to the root level. However, except for such restricted uses, a morpheme
		 dictionary is not a practical tool. For one thing, non-linguists can seldom use a root dictionary. The mind buries abstract
		 representations deep in the subconscious. The only things that are easily accessible to most people are &#8216;words&#8217;. So practical
		 dictionaries are almost always stem dictionaries. Otherwise they run the risk of being difficult or impossible to use for
		 most people (and usually are).
	  </p>
	  <p>Most of us need to produce lexeme dictionaries (also known as stem dictionaries). By this I mean the entries include roots,
		 affixes, derivatives, compounds, and lexical phrases. Even isolating languages have lexical phrases.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sRDVSSD"></a>3.5.2&nbsp;Root dictionaries versus stem dictionaries
	  </h3>
	  <p>There are two ways to arrange entries in an alphabetically organized dictionary&#8212;by root or by stem. A root dictionary places
		 all derivatives, compounds, and phrases under their respective root (or roots) and formats them as subentries. A stem dictionary
		 alphabetizes all the complex forms separately as main entries. In a root dictionary the three entries &#8216;do&#8217; &#8216;doable&#8217; &#8216;redo&#8217;
		 would be organized like this:

	  <p>Notice that complex forms that are derived by suffix will alphabetize near each other, but those that are derived by prefix
		 will alphabetize elsewhere. So if your language only has derivational suffixes, the difference between a root dictionary and
		 a stem dictionary will be small. But if your language has lots of derivational prefixes, the difference will be very great.
		 Derivational prefixes scatter the derivatives throughout a stem dictionary.

	  <h4 style=""><a name="sAdvDisadv"></a>3.5.2.1&nbsp;Advantages and disadvantages of root and stem dictionaries
	  </h4>
	  <p>Most dictionaries are neither root nor stem dictionaries, but a combination of the two. The reason for this is that there
		 are advantages and disadvantages to each type. So most lexicographers choose some sort of compromise.
	  </p>
	  <p>The most serious disadvantage of a root dictionary is that the entries are hard to find, especially for someone who does not
		 know the language well. For someone who is not familiar with English the words '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">redo</span>' and '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">redolent</span>' look similar. But '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">redo</span>' is derived from '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">do</span>' and would be a subentry under '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">do</span>'. On the other hand '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">redolent</span>' is borrowed from French and is based on the same root as '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">odor</span>' and '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">olfactory</span>'. Oddly enough the derivational prefix '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">re-/red-</span>' (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">'re-do</span>' and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'red-ol-ent</span>') is the same in the two words, but hardly anyone except a historical linguist would know this. So almost no one would know
		 to look for '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">redolent</span>' under a root '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">od</span>' or '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">ol</span>'.
	  </p>
	  <p>The greatest advantage of a root dictionary is that the user can see at a glance all the complex forms based on the root.
		 He can compare them and see semantic similarities.
	  </p>
	  <p>One compromise that is sometimes taken is to make all complex forms into main entries, but also list them as cross-references
		 at the end of the root entry:

	  <p>Some language families, such as Afro-Asiatic, have a tradition of root dictionaries. However you should test your intended

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sWordDict"></a>3.5.3&nbsp;Word dictionaries
	  </h3>
	  <p>Some lexicographers want to produce a dictionary of single words. There are two types of word dictionaries. The first type
		 lists all fully formed words, including inflected forms. The second type only lists stems (perhaps using an inflected form
		 as the citation form). A spelling dictionary can be of either type.
	  </p>
	  <p>The problem with word dictionaries is that about one third of the lexemes in a language are lexical phrases. Some lexicographers
		 produce a word dictionary, but list the lexical phrases at the end of the entry for the root. Sometimes they include a definition
		 of the phrase. Such a dictionary is something between a root dictionary and a stem dictionary. (In fact it would be accurate
		 to call it a stem dictionary.) Language Explorer enables you to produce such a dictionary. To do this, you need to click the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Exclude As Headword</span> field in each entry that is a phrase.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sMonoVSBiling"></a>3.5.4&nbsp;Monolingual versus bilingual dictionaries
	  </h3>
	  <p>Language Explorer enables you to produce either a monolingual or bilingual dictionary. A monolingual dictionary uses the vernacular
		 language to describe the words. For instance a monolingual Swahili dictionary is a list of Swahili words with definitions
		 (and other parts of the description) in Swahili. In contrast a bilingual dictionary is a list of vernacular words, but the
		 description is in a second language. For instance a Swahili-English bilingual dictionary would contain a list of Swahili words,
		 but the description would be in English. An English-Swahili dictionary would be a list of English words with the description
		 in Swahili.
	  </p>
	  <p>Sometimes dictionary publishers will combine a Swahili-English and English-Swahili dictionary in one volume. You can produce
		 such a dictionary with FieldWorks, but unfortunately you cannot do so in a single project. You must set up one project for
		 the Swahili-English dictionary and a second project for the English-Swahili dictionary. This makes it difficult to coordinate
		 the two halves.
	  </p>
	  <p>Producing a double Swahili-English, English-Swahili dictionary really involves producing two separate dictionaries. The first
		 requires you to describe all the words of Swahili; the second requires you to describe all the words of English. Most dictionary
		 projects for minority languages do not have the resources to produce both. So many projects choose to produce a single Swahili-English
		 dictionary with an index of English words. In such a dictionary the first language is called the vernacular language and the
		 second language is called the analysis language. In a monolingual dictionary the vernacular and analysis languages are the
		 same. In a Swahili-English dictionary the vernacular language is Swahili and the analysis language is English.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer currently supports monolingual and bilingual dictionaries. It also allows you to set up more than one analysis
		 language. For instance, if you want to produce a dictionary for Swahili, the vernacular language is Swahili. But you can set
		 up Swahili, English, French, and Portuguese as analysis languages. This makes it possible to export the database as a monolingual
		 Swahili dictionary, a Swahili-English bilingual dictionary, a Swahili-French bilingual dictionary, or a Swahili-Portuguese
		 bilingual dictionary. You could even export the database as a multilingual dictionary with the definitions in Swahili, English,
		 French, and Portuguese. So Language Explorer is designed to enable you to maintain a single database for multiple purposes.
	  </p>
	  <p>If you do not have the resources to produce a double Swahili-English, English-Swahili dictionary, you can produce a single
		 Swahili-English dictionary and an index of English words. Such an index is merely a list of English words indicating the equivalent
		 Swahili entry. In other words it helps the user find a Swahili entry. An index like this is sometimes called a 'finder list'.
		 In Language Explorer it is called a 'reversal index'. Language Explorer enables you to produce a reversal index for each analysis
		 language. So for our Swahili dictionary we could produce an English index, a French index, and a Portuguese index. You create
		 reversal index entries in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Entries</span> field. Since a word can have different meanings and each meaning may have a different translation equivalent in the analysis
		 language, the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Entries</span> field is a sense level field. So you create a reversal entry for each sense of an entry in the lexicon. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Indexes</span> view enables you to see what the index will look like and to edit individual reversal entries. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Reversal Entries</span> area enables you to use the bulk edit tools to edit large numbers of reversal entries at once.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sDialects"></a>3.6&nbsp;Dialects
	  </h2>
	  <p>Language Explorer is designed to help you handle minor dialectal differences. However it is not designed to handle dialects
		 that are quite different. If your language has multiple dialects, you can indicate differences between them as long as there
		 aren't too many differences and the differences are not very complicated. However if there are many differences, especially
		 if there are many dialects, you will have difficulty keeping track of all the differences. Your dictionary will quickly fill
		 up with minor entries and cross-references.
	  </p>
	  <p>If you have multiple dialects, you need to pick one as the primary dialect. Sometimes for political reasons all dialects have
		 to be treated evenly in a published dictionary. It is possible to print your dictionary as if all dialects are equal. But
		 Language Explorer requires you to enter your data as if one dialect was primary. Even if all your dialects are equal in size
		 and prestige, you still need to pick one as the primary dialect because of the way Language Explorer handles dialects. The
		 reason for this is that it assumes that one entry will be the main entry and other dialectal forms will be handled in minor
		 entries. You can duplicate all the information from the main entry in the minor entry and make it look like the two entries
		 are equal. But Language Explorer still treats one entry as the main entry. The reason is that duplicating an entry each time
		 there is a difference in the dialects would quickly increase the size of the dictionary. So traditionally dictionaries have
		 picked one dialect as primary and handled dialectal variants with small minor entries. Language Explorer was designed to support
		 this tradition.
	  </p>
	  <p>Regular differences in pronunciation between dialects should be described in the introduction to the dictionary or in the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar Sketch</span>. These regular differences should be ignored in the dictionary entries. If a dialectal variant is different from the basic
		 form in spelling, you should enter the variant in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section. If a dialectal variant is the same as the basic form in spelling, but irregular in pronunciation, you should create
		 a separate pronunciation for it in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field and indicate the dialect in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Location</span> field. If two dialects use two different lexemes for the same sense, you should link the relevant senses of the two entries
		 using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field. You should set up a lexical relations type for each dialect. You do this in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists-Lexical Relations</span> area.
	  </p>
	  <p>Dictionaries often indicate differences in spelling and pronunciation between dialects. But dialects do not just differ in
		 form. A lexeme can vary in any aspect of its form, grammar, meaning, or function. There may be differences in grammatical
		 category, inflection potential, and syntactic restrictions. Different dialects may require different definitions. There may
		 be differences in sociolinguistic usage. Dialects may differ in how a word is spelled or pronounced. But they may also use
		 different lexemes for the same meaning (e.g. British <span style="color:#0000ff; ">lift</span> and American <span style="color:#0000ff; ">elevator</span>). Some dialects have a lexeme, but there is no equivalent lexeme in the other dialects. For instance the Australian word
		 <span style="color:#0000ff; ">joey</span> means <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'baby kangaroo'</span>. But there is no equivalent word in American English. We have to use a descriptive phrase, such as <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'a baby kangaroo'</span> or <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'the kangaroo's baby'</span>, when we want to talk about it. So one of the challenges in handling multiple dialects is to identify all the differences
		 between the dialects and developing ways to indicate the differences. Currently there is no mechanism in Language Explorer
		 to indicate which fields apply to which dialects. For instance there is no way to indicate that an example sentence is in
		 one of the dialects. This makes it very difficult to describe dialectal differences other than differences in form.
	  </p>
	  <p>If you have dialects that are very different, you may find that the number of differences is so large that it is very difficult
		 to handle them all. This can also be a problem if you are trying to handle many dialects in a single dictionary. With major
		 differences and multiple dialects the complexity will increase exponentially. You may find that your dictionary becomes cluttered
		 with lots of notes on dialectal differences, lots of minor entries for variants, and lots of cross-references. If this is
		 the case, you may want to limit your dictionary to a single dialect. There may be political reasons why you have to handle
		 multiple dialects in a single dictionary. But this may cause serious problems for you. It might be better to create separate
		 dictionaries for each dialect. To do so in Language Explorer means setting up more than one project. Language Explorer does
		 not have the capability of cross-referencing two projects. So it is very difficult to simultaneously manage multiple projects
		 for multiple dialects.
	  </p>
	  <p>Some lexicographers want to set up one project to handle multiple dialects, but export the data in order to produce a separate
		 dictionary for each dialect. This is very difficult to do in Language Explorer. It is possible to set up a custom field in
		 which you indicate which dialects use each entry. For instance the entry for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">joey</span> could be marked as Australian. It would be possible to filter the database for each dialect and only export those entries
		 that are marked for a particular dialect. However some entries have senses that are limited to one dialect. For instance the
		 meaning for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">lift</span> <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'a machine for moving people and freight between the floors of a building'</span> is used in British English but not in American English. However other senses of the word are shared by both dialects. It
		 is not currently possible to filter out senses when exporting the dictionary. Instead you would have to create two entries
		 for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">lift</span>, one for the British dialect and one for the American. However I'm not even sure this would work. Instead Language Explorer
		 would need the ability to save multiple configurations in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Dictionary</span> tool, and to exclude senses (and fields) from a particular configuration.
	  </p>
	  <p>For some purposes, such as machine translation, it is necessary to indicate correspondences between dialects or related languages.
		 You can do this in Language Explorer by setting up each dialect as an analysis language and then providing a gloss for each
		 dialect. Alternatively you can set up custom fields to handle the correspondences.
	  </p>
	  <p>As with any project in Language Explorer, you have to decide what language or languages to use as the analysis language. If
		 you are producing a monolingual dictionary, you will most likely have to choose one dialect as the analysis language. It is
		 simply not practical to use each dialect as an analysis language when you have several dialects.
	  </p>
	  <p>In summary, Language Explorer can handle multiple dialects if the dialects are close and if the differences are mostly limited
		 to spelling and pronunciation. If there are many differences and if the differences include grammar, semantics, and pragmatics,
		 it would be best to handle the dialects in separate projects.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sPolysemy"></a>3.7&nbsp;Lexemes with more than one meaning
	  </h2>
	  <p>Many of the words in a language have more than one meaning. This is especially true of the common words. Language Explorer
		 enables you to create a separate sense for each meaning of a word. Each entry already has a section for the primary sense
		 of the entry. The section begins with the label <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense 1</span>. You can add a section for another sense by clicking anywhere on this line and then clicking <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Insert Sense</span>. Language Explorer creates another sense section and labels it <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense 2</span>. All the sense level fields are duplicated for each sense section.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer automatically numbers each sense. However some lexicographers prefer to subordinate some senses under others.
		 Consider the following entry:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">

						   </div>
						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>The first three senses are about physical movement. The first one is very general in meaning and the next two are specific
		 types of upward movement. The fourth and fifth senses are metaphorical and are actually referring to a change. They depend
		 on the conceptual metaphor, "More is up, less is down." Sense 5 can be considered a specific application of the more general
		 meaning in sense 4. The last sense does not involve movement or change. So instead of merely listing the senses, we could
		 group them as follows:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">

		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>Language Explorer allows you to do this. If you click anywhere on the first line of a sense (the line that says <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense 2</span>), a small blue down arrow will appear on the left side of the line. If you click the blue arrow, you will get a menu of options.
		 You can also get the menu by right clicking on the line. This menu doesn't have a name, but I'll call it the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense</span> menu. It has a number of useful options for managing the senses of an entry. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Demote</span> option subordinates one sense under another. To change example <a href="#xRise">(63)</a> into example <a href="#xRise11">(64)</a>, I demoted senses 2, 3, and 5. To reverse this process, you can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Promote</span> option.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can also reorder senses. For instance you might want to make sense 4 in example <a href="#xRise">(63)</a> the first sense because it is the most frequently used meaning. To reorder senses, choose <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Move Sense Up</span> or <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Move Sense Down</span> from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense</span> menu.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can merge two senses using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Merge Sense into...</span> option from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense</span> menu. For instance if you call up the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense</span> menu from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense 2</span> line and choose <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Merge Sense into...</span>, you will get the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Merge Sense</span> dialog box. This displays the definitions from each of the senses in the entry. You would then pick one of the definitions
		 and click <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Merge</span>. For instance if you pick the first definition, sense 2 will be merged into sense 1. Sense 2 will be deleted and the contents
		 of each field from sense 2 will be added to the end of the respective field in sense 1.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Move Sense to a New Entry</span> option enables you to split an entry. It will create a new entry with the same entry level fields and move the sense into
		 the new entry. This option is especially useful when you find that an entry has two unrelated senses and you want to split
		 the entry into homonyms.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sMultiGram"></a>3.8&nbsp;Multiple senses and grammatical category
	  </h2>
	  <p>Many lexemes have more than one sense and sometimes those senses belong to more than one grammatical category. Language Explorer
		 requires you to give the grammatical category of each sense. The reason for this is because the interlinearizer and parser
		 link wordforms to a particular sense of an entry and need to know the grammatical category of that sense. Because some dictionaries
		 intermix senses with different grammatical categories, each sense must be given a grammatical category to eliminate possible
		 confusion.
	  </p>
	  <p>Various dictionaries use different systems to handle lexemes that belong to more than one grammatical category. The following
		 examples illustrate some of the options and which ones are possible in Language Explorer.
	  </p>
	  <p>Some dictionaries do not combine senses with different grammatical categories into a single entry. Instead they separate them
		 into homonyms as in the following example:

	  <h2 style=""><a name="sTrEq"></a>3.9&nbsp;Translation equivalents
	  </h2>
	  <p>A translation equivalent is a word in the analysis language that could be used to translate the vernacular lexeme in a particular
		 context. Many bilingual dictionaries start off in their early stages as nothing more than a list of vernacular lexemes with
		 a simple gloss or translation equivalent. A gloss generally tries to capture the essence of the meaning of the vernacular
		 word. On the other hand a vernacular word may have quite a few translation equivalents in different contexts, even for a single
		 sense.
	  </p>
	  <p>Dictionaries for translators often include translation equivalents for the vernacular lexeme. Other kinds of dictionaries,
		 such as glossaries or a trilingual vocabulary in three column format, also employ translation equivalents rather than full
		 definitions.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer has no standard field for translation equivalents. So you have several options:</p>
	  <ol style="list-style-type:decimal; ">
		 <li>You can use the Gloss field to store a translation equivalent. However currently Language Explorer only allows a single gloss
			in the Gloss field. So it is difficult to use the Gloss field if you have more than one translation equivalent.
		 </li>
		 <li>You can create a custom field for translation equivalents. However a custom field is a simple string of characters. So if
			you have more than one translation equivalent and you want to sort on each one, you cannot do so with a custom field.
		 </li>
		 <li>You can include translation equivalents in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field. Sometimes you will need to use a translation equivalent as part of the definition. At other times you may want to
			first give a translation equivalent and then the definition. This is a good idea if the two words are quite similar and the
			definition merely clarifies some differences between the two. In other cases you may want to give the definition first, followed
			by several translation equivalents. This is a good idea if the translation equivalents are not very close in meaning to the
			vernacular word and the user needs to be alerted to this.
		 </li>
		 <li>You ought to include translation equivalents in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Indexes</span> field. But the need to alphabetize the reversal index entries sometime requires that the translation equivalent be rearranged,
			as in 'brother, older' rather than 'older brother'.
		 </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>It is generally not advisable to define a word using translation equivalents. An exception to this rule might be a dictionary
		 designed for bilingual translators whose primary need is to know what options he has for translating a particular word in
		 a particular context. In contrast most language learners need a description of the meaning of a word, especially when the
		 languages are not closely related. There are several reasons for this:
	  </p>
	  <ol style="list-style-type:decimal; ">
		 <li>Translation equivalents are never exactly equivalent in meaning and usage to the vernacular word. Sometimes there is a similar
			word, but the meanings are slightly different. For instance the Koine Greek word <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">amphoreus</span> <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#00cc00; ">'a large pottery jar with two handles, used for storing liquids, approximately nine gallons in capacity'</span> and the English word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">jar</span> <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#00cc00; ">'a rounded glass container with a lid, used for storing food, approximately one or two cups in capacity'</span> may be translation equivalents in some contexts, but are not equivalent in meaning.
		 </li>
		 <li>A series of translation equivalents will include words that are not equivalent to each other. This leaves the user unsure
			if the meaning of the vernacular word is the sum total of all the translation equivalents or if he should try to look for
			some element of meaning that all the translation equivalents have in common.
		 </li>
		 <li>Sometimes there is no equivalent lexeme in the analysis language. When I was studying Maguindanaon, I was given a word that
			meant <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#00cc00; ">'the cap-like part of a coconut where the stem attaches to the nut'</span>. I had no translation equivalent in English for this part of a coconut.
		 </li>
		 <li>Sometimes the concept itself is missing. Many languages have no word for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">snow</span> and the people have no experience of it. Even a lengthy definition may fail to adequately communicate the idea: <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#00cc00; ">'rain that has turned hard because it is very cold, and looks like very small white feathers'</span>.
		 </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>For these reasons a good bilingual dictionary will combine a good descriptive definition with one or more translation equivalents.</p>
	  <h1 style=""><a name="sProcedure"></a>4&nbsp;Recommended step by step procedure for developing a dictionary
	  </h1>
	  <p>There are many ways to approach the development of a dictionary. However I recommend that you use the following step by step
		 procedure. The procedure divides the total task into five basic stages:
	  </p>
	  <ol style="list-style-type:decimal; ">
		 <li>Collecting words</li>
		 <li>Filling in fields</li>
		 <li>Defining the words</li>
		 <li>Editing each entry</li>
		 <li>Preparing the front and back matter</li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>This procedure reflects a great deal of thought on the best way to develop a dictionary. It will enable you to work efficiently
		 and systematically to develop your dictionary. It makes maximal use of the power of Language Explorer. Since the production
		 of a dictionary may take many years, this procedure places stages 1 and 2 at the beginning. This enables you to quickly collect
		 a large number of lexemes and quickly expand the list of lexemes into a very basic dictionary that can be used as a tool throughout
		 the length of the project. However Language Explorer does not require you to follow this procedure. You are free to use whatever
		 approach you feel is best.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sStage1"></a>4.1&nbsp;Stage 1&#8212;Collecting words
	  </h2>
	  <p>Lexicographers have proposed many methods for collecting words: (1) use semantic domains, (2) generate a word list from a
		 text corpus, (3) use standard wordlists or published dictionaries, (4) generate a list of all possible wordforms. I recommend
		 using the first two methods. Each has its advantages and the combination will ensure that your dictionary is large, covers
		 all areas of the lexicon, and includes all high frequency words. The third and fourth methods are less useful than the first
		 two because they do not have some of the beneficial side effects of the first two methods. But lexicographers have used them
		 successfully.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sCollectSemD"></a>4.1.1&nbsp;Collecting words using semantic domains
	  </h3>
	  <p>This method involves asking speakers of the language to think of all the words that belong to a particular semantic domain.
		 In order to use the method, you need a list of semantic domains. A large list of domains for this purpose has been incorporated
		 into Language Explorer and can be found in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span> tool in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon</span> area. The list is also available in printable format from the Rapid Word Collection website (http://rapidwords.net/). The
		 website includes detailed instructions for its use in a workshop setting.
	  </p>
	  <p>Briefly the method involves gathering a group of native speakers of a language in a workshop. The speakers are trained in
		 the method and then work approximately ten days to collect as many words as they can. They are provided with a copy of the
		 list of domains. Each domain includes a few elicitation questions and sample words that help them understand the domain and
		 the type of words that might be included in it. They then use their mental network to think of words in their language that
		 belong to the domain. They write the words down on paper and a typist types them into the program. Approximately 200 language
		 development projects have used the method to collect thousands of words. Most collect well over 10,000 words and one project
		 collected over 20,000. By collecting words in semantic domains, the words are automatically classified. So the result is a
		 classified word list (or what is more popularly called a thesaurus).
	  </p>
	  <p>This method is by far the most effective method known. It is easy. It is low-tech. It allows native speakers to be involved.
		 It is highly productive. It collects idiomatic phrases as well as individual words. It collects words in their citation form.
		 It doesn't depend on the availability of a large text corpus. And perhaps most important, it classifies the words, giving
		 you an indication of their meaning and providing a basis for later semantic research.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sCollectText"></a>4.1.2&nbsp;Collecting words by generating a word list from a text corpus
	  </h3>
	  <p>This method involves using a concordance program to generate a list of words occurring in a text corpus. In order to use the
		 method, you need a large text corpus. Otherwise the method will not generate very many words. There are other problems with
		 the method. It does not generate any phrases. Since about one fourth of the lexemes in a language are phrases, this is a very
		 serious drawback.
	  </p>
	  <p>If you are in an isolating language (one with few affixes), most of the words in the list will correspond with the citation
		 forms in a dictionary. But if you are in an inflecting language (one with many inflectional affixes), most of the words in
		 the list will have affixes. You will need some way to give the correct citation form for each word. This is a time consuming
		 process. Either you need to develop a parser, or someone needs to type the correct citation form for each inflected word.
	  </p>
	  <p>A word list from a large text corpus in an inflecting language can easily have hundreds of thousands of unique forms. If you
		 find yourself in this situation, it is impractical to type the correct citation form for each inflected word. Instead you
		 will need to work out an automated way of generating the correct citation form.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer automatically generates a list of word forms when you import or type a text into the program. The list can
		 be viewed in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts &amp; Words</span> area. The program also has powerful editing tools in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon--Bulk Edit</span> areas that can be used to strip affixes off each form in the dictionary. Unfortunately these tools are not currently available
		 to do bulk edits of the word form list. Hopefully future versions will enable you to efficiently parse the word form list
		 and create any missing dictionary entries.<span style="font-size:65%; vertical-align:super">[<a href="#nParseWrdLst">8</a>]</span></p>
	  <p>In spite of these limitations, the text corpus method has many advantages. It collects all high frequency words. It can give
		 an indication of a word's frequency. It gives an indication of the affixation potential of words. And perhaps most important,
		 it provides a text corpus for later semantic research.
	  </p>
	  <p>Because the semantic domain method and text corpus method each has advantages, I recommend that you use both. Using one or
		 the other will give you good results, but using both will result in significantly more words and provide a better foundation
		 than either method can alone.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sCollectWrdList"></a>4.1.3&nbsp;Collecting words using word lists and published dictionaries
	  </h3>
	  <p>For cross-linguistic comparisons, it is good to ensure that words in standard wordlists (such as the Swadesh 200 list or the
		 SIL Comparative African Word List) have been included in the dictionary. It is fairly easy to fill out one of these words
		 lists, type the results, and import them into Language Explorer.
	  </p>
	  <p>A similar method is to use a published dictionary of another language as a word list. The basic procedure is to look at each
		 word in the dictionary and try to think of the equivalent word (or words) in your language. It is best to get a dictionary
		 that is closely related to your own, because it is more likely that their words will be related to yours and their concepts
		 will be similar to yours. You should also try to find an etymological dictionary of your language family, especially one that
		 includes reconstructed proto forms, because this will also give you etymological information for the words you collect. If
		 you are planning to produce a bilingual dictionary, it would be good to get a dictionary of the analysis language and try
		 to find as many equivalents as possible. If you type both the vernacular and analysis language words, this will help you to
		 produce a reversal index.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sCollectWrdFrms"></a>4.1.4&nbsp;Collecting words by generating a list of possible wordforms
	  </h3>
	  <p>Several linguists have used a computer to generate a list of possible wordforms. To do this you would need a knowledge of
		 the phonology of your language. The basic idea is to determine what syllable patterns are allowed in your language and what
		 consonants and vowels can occur in each position in the syllable structure. On the basis of this information the computer
		 generates a list of all possible words. A speaker of the language then goes through this list and marks the ones that are
		 actual words. Bill Poser has developed a program called WordGenerator that can be downloaded from the following website (http://billposer.org/Software/WordGenerator.html).
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sStage2"></a>4.2&nbsp;Stage 2&#8212;Filling in fields
	  </h2>
	  <p>I recommend that you develop your dictionary by working on one field at a time. I recommend that you add fields in the order
		 presented here. There is a logic to the order, since some steps build on others. You may want or need to skip a step, but
		 each step has proven to be useful in a project.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer has all the standard fields available for each entry. There is no need to add blank fields. You can choose
		 which fields will be shown in each view, but the fields are always available. You may need to add a custom (user-defined)
		 field if you have special needs or if you want an extra field for analysis purposes. For more on adding custom fields see
		 section <a href="#sAddCustom">4.2.14</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sAddDef"></a>4.2.1&nbsp;Giving a short definition
	  </h3>
	  <p>The process of doing semantic analysis and writing definitions is the most time consuming task in lexicography. Rather than
		 wait months or years to add a definition, I recommend that you give a gloss or simple definition for each sense of each entry
		 right at the beginning of the project. This is a temporary step so that you will at least have a basic idea of what the word
		 means while you wait for the word to be carefully defined. This is especially important when a word has more than one sense
		 or more than one grammatical category. Without some indication of the meaning, you may make mistakes when filling in other
		 fields. For instance in the Maguindanaon language of the Philippines the word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">atep</span> can mean <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'roof</span>' or <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'make a roof'</span>. Giving a short definition for each helps you to realize that the word has two senses and enables you to give the correct
		 grammatical category for each.
	  </p>
	  <p>The initial definition does not have to be accurate or complete. The purpose is not to provide a polished definition, but
		 just to give some indication of the meaning. The definition may consist of a single word or brief description of the meaning
		 of the word. This should be done quickly at this stage of the project. If you are using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span> tool to add words, it is best to enter a short definition at the same time. If you have lots of words in the database with
		 no definitions, you can add definitions in one of the browse views.
	  </p>
	  <p>If you are developing a bilingual dictionary, the definition should be in the analysis language. It is easiest to simply give
		 the closest equivalent in the analysis language. If there is no single word that means roughly the same thing, you should
		 give a short phrase describing the meaning. The definition should be put in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field rather than the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field, even if it consists of a single word. We will add a gloss in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field in a later step.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sSpecMorphT"></a>4.2.2&nbsp;Specifying the morpheme type
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field is used to distinguish various types of affixes, roots, stems, and phrases. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field is used by the parser and interlinear tool to correctly parse words. If you do not specify the morpheme type, the program
		 assumes it is a stem by default. You can view the list of <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Types</span> in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area. However you cannot add to the list. If you feel you need an additional morpheme type that is not in the list, you can
		 write to the FieldWorks team and suggest that it be added.
	  </p>
	  <p>The program recognizes two subsets of the list--affixes and non-affixes (roots, stems, and phrases). When you add a new entry
		 to the dictionary, you should use a hyphen to indicate if it is an affix. For instance the English suffix <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'ed'</span> should be entered with a preceding hyphen '-ed' and the English prefix <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'un'</span> should be entered as 'un-'. When Language Explorer sees the hyphen, it knows that the entry is an affix. So when you indicate
		 the morpheme type in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field, the program only displays the list of affixes. Similarly, if there is no hyphen in the lexeme form, the program only
		 displays the list of non-affix morpheme types.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can specify the morpheme type in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon--Lexicon Edit--Entry</span> pane by clicking the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field and then choosing the correct morpheme type from the list. However it is much more efficient to use <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries&#8212;List Choice</span>. You can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Find</span> function in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field to filter the database for affixes by finding a hyphen, either at the start or end of the field. Specify <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Target Field</span> box, then specify the morpheme type in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Change to:</span> box. You can also filter for phrases by finding a space. You can also simply use the check boxes on the left of the pane
		 to choose all the entries that are of a particular morpheme type. In this way you can rapidly specify the morpheme type for
		 all the entries in a large database.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sSpecCompFrmT"></a>4.2.3&nbsp;Specifying the complex form type
	  </h3>
	  <p>You use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Form Type</span> field to specify various types of complex forms--lexemes that are composed of more than one morpheme. Language Explorer uses
		 this information to format a root-based dictionary. The list of complex forms is maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists--Complex Form Types</span> area. There are three basic types of complex forms--derivatives, compounds, and phrases. In a root-based dictionary complex
		 forms are usually presented as subentries. In a stem-based dictionary complex forms are usually presented a main entries.
		 However you may choose to produce something in between a root-based and stem-based dictionary by making derivatives and compounds
		 main entries, but make phrases subentries. You can configure your dictionary in any of these ways by using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Dictionary</span> tool under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools</span> menu. Complex forms may also need to be presented as minor entries to help the user find the correct main entry.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer requires you to enter all complex forms as separate entries in the database, but this does not mean that
		 you must present them as main entries in a published dictionary. Instead the program gives you options for how to present
		 them. In order to format each type of entry, the program must know which entries are complex forms and what type they are.
		 Once you have specified the complex form type, you can specify how they should be presented in your published dictionary.
		 You can choose different presentation options in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists--Complex Form Types</span> area.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can specify the complex form type in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon--Lexicon Edit--Entry</span> pane by clicking the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Form Type</span> field and then choosing the correct complex form type from the list. However it is much more efficient to use <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries&#8212;List Choice</span>. You can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Find</span> function in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field to filter the database for a space in order to find lexical phrases such as idioms. Specify <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Form Type</span> in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Target Field</span> box, then specify the complex form type in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Change to:</span> box. You can also filter for particular derivational affixes in order to specify derivatives. You can also simply use the
		 check boxes on the left of the pane to choose all the entries that are of a particular complex form type. In this way you
		 can rapidly specify the complex form type for all the entries in a large database.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sSpecGramCat"></a>4.2.4&nbsp;Specifying the grammatical category (part of speech)
	  </h3>
	  <p>Grammatical category has traditionally been called 'part of speech'. However the term 'grammatical category' is a more accurate
		 description of what is being recorded. In Language Explorer grammatical category is one part of a larger system called <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span>. <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span> includes <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Category</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Class</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Feature</span>, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Exception Feature</span>. Since different senses of a word may have different grammatical categories, these fields are sense level fields.
	  </p>
	  <p>In Language Explorer grammatical category is subordinate to sense. In other programs, such as Shoebox, you could have a single
		 grammatical category with several senses under it. But in FieldWorks you must specify the grammatical category of each sense.
		 If you add a second sense to an entry, the grammatical category will be copied from the first sense to the second. If this
		 is not correct, you will have to correct it. If you are not sure of the grammatical category, you can select &lt;Not Sure&gt; from
		 the list. You can specify the grammatical category in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit--Entry</span> pane by clicking the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Category</span> field and then choosing the correct grammatical category from the list. However it is much more efficient to use <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries&#8212;List Choice</span>. If your language has inflectional or derivational affixes that indicate the grammatical category of the word, you can use
		 these affixes to quickly identify and specify the grammatical category. For instance in English the derivational suffixes
		 '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">-ment'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'-tion'</span> produce nouns, the suffixes <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'-ize'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'-ate'</span> produce verbs, the suffixes '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">-ful'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'-able'</span> produce adjectives, and the suffix <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'-ly'</span> produces adverbs. If your language has affixes like these, you can use them to specify the grammatical category for large
		 groups of words all at once. To use this technique, use the following procedure:
	  </p>
	  <ol style="list-style-type:decimal; ">
		 <li>Use <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries--List Choice</span>.
		 </li>
		 <li>In the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Target Field</span> box choose <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Category</span>.
		 </li>
		 <li>Use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Find</span> function in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field to filter the database for the affix.
		 </li>
		 <li>In the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Change To:</span> box choose the grammatical category indicated by the affix.
		 </li>
		 <li>Click <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Preview</span> and use the check boxes in the left column to eliminate exceptions.
		 </li>
		 <li>Click <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Apply</span>.
		 </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>You can <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Filter</span> for the affix, specify <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category</span> in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Target Field</span> box, then specify the category .
	  </p>
	  <p>If your language does not have affixes that indicate the grammatical category, or if some words have no affixes, you can simply
		 use the check boxes on the left of the pane to choose all the entries that are of a particular category. Use the following
		 method:

		 </li>
		 <li>If you have classified your dictionary by semantic domain, sort on the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Semantic Domain</span> field. This tends to group lexemes that belong to the same grammatical category.
		 </li>
		 <li>In the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Change To:</span> box choose the most common grammatical category (probably noun). It might be better to start with the least common categories
			(such as connectives, particles, or pro-forms), especially if you can easily find them by sorting by semantic domain.
		 </li>
		 <li>Click the check box (in the left column) next to each noun (if you are working on nouns).</li>
		 <li>After working awhile, click <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Apply</span> to save your choices.
		 </li>
		 <li>When you finish the most common grammatical category, select the next most common category (probably verb) in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Change To:</span> box and work on it.

	  <p>Using these methods you can rapidly specify the category for all the entries in a large database.</p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sAddParadigm"></a>4.2.5&nbsp;Adding paradigm (inflected) forms
	  </h3>
	  <p>Many languages have inflectional affixes that occur on nouns, verbs, and other grammatical categories. Some languages have
		 a few nouns or verbs that are irregular in their inflection. Other languages have large classes of nouns or verbs that take
		 different sets of affixes. Linguists like to organize the inflected forms of a word in a chart called a 'paradigm'. The term
		 paradigm is also used to refer to all the inflected forms of a single word. Each inflected form is called a 'paradigm form'.
	  </p>
	  <p>Some lexicographers want to indicate one or more of these inflected forms in the published dictionary. For instance most English
		 dictionaries indicate the plural form of irregular nouns (woman, women) and the forms of irregular verbs (do, does, doing,
		 did, done). (If your language only has a few irregularly inflected forms, they would normally be handled by creating a separate
		 entry for each irregularly inflected form.) Other languages have noun classes or verb classes that need to be indicated in
		 the dictionary. For instance the plural forms of many nouns in most Bantu languages cannot be predicted from the singular.
		 So the tradition in Bantu language dictionaries is to indicate the plural form of each noun, as in the following entries from
		 Lunyole:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xOmugangi1">(71)</a></td>

Herbalist, doctor.
						   </div>
						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>

						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>You may also want to generate one or more sets of inflected forms for each word to help you analyze the patterns, determine
		 what classes you have, and identify morphophonemic rules. For instance you might want to create a custom field in which you
		 list the plural form of each noun or the past tense of each verb. In order to create a field for a particular paradigm form,
		 do the following steps:
	  </p>
	  <ol style="list-style-type:decimal; ">
		 <li>Set up a custom field for each paradigm form. Go to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools</span> menu and select <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Custom Fields</span>. Add a custom field for a paradigm form and give it an appropriate name (e.g. 'Plural'). If you want to record a second paradigm
			form, add a second custom field and give it a name (e.g. 'Past').
		 </li>
		 <li>Go to <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries</span> and use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Choose...</span> function to filter the database for a grammatical category. (or whatever else you need to do to focus on the entries you

		 </li>
		 <li>Use Bulk Edit Entries&#8212;Bulk Replace to add affixes and change the stem to the correct allomorph. In the Target box choose one

	  <p>An inflection class is a set of nouns, verbs, or other grammatical category that takes an unconditioned allomorph of an affix.
		 For instance the English nouns that form their plurals by replacing a vowel (man/men, woman/women, goose/geese) form an inflection

	  </p>
	  <p>Words are first added to the database in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field. If your language uses an inflected form for the citation form, the words may have been collected and entered in their

The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field is intended to contain the unaffixed stem and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field is intended to contain an inflected form that will be used as the headword in the dictionary entries. So if your language
		 uses an inflected form for the citation form, you need to fix this situation by copying the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span>, and then deleting inflectional affixes from the word in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field so that it is only the stem.

		 Even if you do not include a pronunciation field for every word, it is important to indicate variant pronunciations that are

	  <p>You can use your dictionary to help analyze the phonology of the language. One important tool in this process is the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">CV Pattern</span> field. For instance the English words <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'stitch'</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'shred</span>' both have the phonological pattern 'CCVC'. But notice that the phonological pattern does not match the pattern of letters
		 in the orthography. In order to find all the words in English with the CV pattern 'CCVC', it is necessary to generate a <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">CV Pattern</span> field for each word in the language. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">CV Pattern</span> field should match the phonological pattern of the words, not the orthographic pattern. A <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">CV Pattern</span> field is useful in studying syllable structure, allophonic variation, tone patterns, and other issues in phonology.

	  <p>Once you have produced a simple definition (see section <a href="#sAddDef">4.2.1</a>), you can efficiently add a single word gloss for each word. If you cannot think of a one-word equivalent, then give a very
		 short phrase, the shorter the better. The gloss is used in interlinearizing texts, so it needs to be as short as possible
		 to keep the lines from becoming too long. In interlinear texts it is conventional to put a period or underline between multiple
		 words in a gloss (e.g. older.brother or older_brother). The gloss can also be used in a browse view to give a short indication
		 of a word's meaning. To fill in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools, use the following procedure:

	  </h2>
	  <p>Semantic investigation is best done in context--in the context of semantic domains and in the context of corpus studies. It
		 is necessary to apply intuition in both contexts. Intuition is needed to identify the members of a semantic domain and to
		 interpret the data derived from the corpus method. Identifying lexical sets within a domain enables us to look at paradigmatic
		 lexical relations, and to contrast and compare the members of the lexical set. Identifying collocates in a text corpus enables
		 us to look at syntagmatic relations. The combination of the two is quite powerful. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span> tool includes a list of semantic domains to help you collect and classify your words. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts &amp; Words</span> area enables you to develop a text corpus and generate a concordance of textual examples to help you study how a word is
		 actually used.

	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">

		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p class="pc">We recognize that the three sentences represent three different senses.</p>
	  <p>In each of the sentences <span style="color:#0000ff; ">follow</span> is a transitive verb with a person as subject and various things as objects. This tells us very little about the meaning
		 of the word. Instead we have to use our intuition about what we know of the word. It helps to have some semantic theory to
		 shed light on the problem. But the primary method that all lexicographers use is to use our native speaker intuition about
		 what a word means and how it is used.
	  </p>
	  <p>We can use our text corpus to generate a concordance of all the sentences that use the word. But this will not give us some
		 very important information that we need to accurately define the word.
	  </p>
	  <p>The first question we need to ask ourselves is, &#8220;What semantic domain does this word belong to?&#8221; The first example sentence
		 is in the domain of movement, specifically in the realm of one person following another person wherever they go. In the Dictionary
		 Development Process (DDP) list of domains this is 7.2.5.2 'Follow'. The second sentence is in the domain of travel, specifically
		 in the realm of giving directions. This is DDP domain 7.2.4 'Travel' or 7.2.4.6 'Way, route'. The third sentence is in the
		 domain of argumentation, specifically in the realm of listening and understanding someone giving a reasoned argument. This
		 is DDP domain 3.2.4 'Understand'.
	  </p>
	  <p>The second question we need to ask ourselves is, &#8220;What other ways do we have of saying the same thing?&#8221; We could reword the
		 first sentence as:

		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>There is no way to form these lexical sets using the text corpus method. We must use our intuition within each relevant semantic
		 domain. So the basic procedure is to identify the semantic domain of each sense. Then within the domain you need to list all
		 the members of the lexical set that the word belongs to. You should work systematically through all the semantic domains of
		 the language.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sDomTemplates"></a>4.3.1.1&nbsp;Domain templates
	  </h4>
	  <p>A domain template is a list of questions to ask about each member of a lexical set. It is best to maintain the words, questions,
		 and the answers to the questions in a chart format. List the questions along the horizontal axis and the words along the vertical
		 axis. Pick the most important or frequent member of the lexical set and investigate it thoroughly. Then pick another member
		 of the set and investigate it. As you investigate each member of the set, you will discover more and more issues to investigate
		 and questions to ask. Patterns will emerge. You can develop a standardized definition for the members of the set. Domain templates
		 will help you be more systematic, will yield better insights, and will speed up the process of investigating and defining
		 the words. Language Explorer does not currently include a place to record domain templates.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sDefCorpus"></a>4.3.2&nbsp;Using the corpus method to define words
	  </h3>
	  <p>The basic procedure is to generate a concordance of all the sentences in the text corpus that use the word. Then look in the
		 context for clues to the word's meaning. For instance if the word is a verb, you would look at what words occur as the subject,
		 object, and indirect object. If the word is a noun, look at what words modify the noun and what verbs it occurs with. Look
		 in the context for any word or set of words that occur frequently. In Language Explorer you can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Concordance</span> feature in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts &amp; Words</span> area to generate a concordance of a word.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sStage4"></a>4.4&nbsp;Stage 4&#8212;Editing the entry
	  </h2>
	  <p>Once you have written good definitions of all the words, you need to work systematically through all the entries to make sure
		 they are ready for publication. You should work through the dictionary in alphabetically order to make sure you don't miss
		 any entries. Develop a checklist of things to look for. The checklist should cover the following items:
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sDistHomonyms"></a>4.4.1&nbsp;Distinguishing homonyms
	  </h3>
	  <p>If the entry contains more than one sense, make sure the senses are related. If they are unrelated, split the entry into homonyms.
		 Language Explorer automatically assigns homonym numbers. If you need to change the order of the homonyms, add the homonym
		 number column to a browse view and edit the numbers there. For more on homonyms see section <a href="#sHomonyms">3.2.5</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>It is sometimes difficult to tell if two senses of a word are related or unrelated. Consider the following entry:</p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">

	  </div>
	  <p>Some of the senses are obviously related. But it is difficult to decide whether others are related. There are several tests.
		 If the two are derived historically from different sources, they are homonyms. If you ask several native speakers to explain
		 the relationship between the senses and each gives a different explanation, they are probably homonyms. If the speakers can't
		 provide a reasonable explanation, they are probably homonyms. The two senses may be related far back in time, but they may
		 have changed so much over the centuries that it is difficult now to see the connection. If a linguist cannot see a reasonable
		 connection and native speakers cannot give one, you should treat them as homonyms. It helps if you have a good understanding
		 of how words change in meaning over time. Such an understanding comes from extensive study of historical linguistics and from
		 study of patterns of polysemy.
	  </p>
	  <p>In example <a href="#xTap">(78)</a> senses 1-3 are related by the idea of a sound produced by tapping. Senses 5 and 6 are related by the idea of drawing a liquid
		 from a pipe. Most native speakers would link sense 4 to 1-3 with an explanation such as, "A tap on a shoe makes a tapping
		 sound on the ground, like in tap dancing." So we would join sense 4 to 1-3. But it is difficult to see any connection between
		 senses 1-4 and 5-6. So we would split this entry into two:

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sProofread"></a>4.4.5&nbsp;Checking for errors and proofreading
	  </h3>
	  <p>Language Explorer has a spell checking function that can help you find spelling errors. You can install spelling dictionaries
		 for each of your analysis languages and then use the spell checking function to find misspelled words. You can also develop
		 a spelling dictionary for the vernacular. For instructions on how to do this see the Help files.
	  </p>
	  <p>There are several things you can do to find errors in your data. One thing I do is to use one of the browse views to systematically
		 sort the database on each field. I go to the top of the file and then to the bottom of the file because some characters such
		 as an extra space or punctuation mark sort before or after the alphabetic characters. I also sort each field from right to
		 left and then go again to the top and bottom of the database. Sometimes it is helpful to scan through the entire field looking
		 for unusual things.
	  </p>
	  <p>The last thing you should do is print the dictionary and proofread the printout. This will help you not only find errors in
		 the data, but will also bring out any problems in the printing process, such as the handling of fonts.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sExportData"></a>4.4.6&nbsp;Exporting the data for publication
	  </h3>
	  <p>Language Explorer currently has a number of export and print options. For instance you can print the Dictionary views for
		 proof reading the content. However it does not have a publication formatting function, meaning you cannot print a photo-ready
		 copy directly from Language Explorer. In order to print the dictionary for publication you must first export the database
		 and then format it using another software package. You can export the configured dictionary to XML or SFM. (You configure
		 the dictionary using the Configure Dictionary tool.) You can export the lexical database in MDF format and then print it using
		 a program such as Lexique Pro. Lexique Pro enables you to publish in print or on the web. You can export the reversal index
		 to XML or SFM.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sStage5"></a>4.5&nbsp;Stage 5&#8212;Preparing the front and back matter
	  </h2>
	  <p>Once you have produced the dictionary entries, the last stage is to prepare the material that comes at the beginning and end
		 of the book. Language Explorer currently does not provide a place for you to enter this material in the program. You would
		 need to use another program, such as a word processor to produce the materials. The front and back matter includes the following
		 parts.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sFMCovers"></a>4.5.1&nbsp;The covers
	  </h3>
	  <p>Pick a design that reflects something of the culture, such as a cultural artifact. Use a color scheme that is used by the
		 people and that they find attractive. This will help the people to feel that it is their dictionary. Make it eye-catching
		 so that it will sell well.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sFMTitlePage"></a>4.5.2&nbsp;The title page
	  </h3>
	  <p>The layout of the title page varies depending on the publishing traditions in the country where the book will be published.
		 You should find examples of dictionaries and use them as a pattern.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sFMCopyright"></a>4.5.3&nbsp;The copyright page
	  </h3>
	  <p>The layout and contents of the copyright page depend on the laws of the country where the book will be published. You should
		 consult with the publisher on the requirements.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sFMTableCont"></a>4.5.4&nbsp;Table of contents
	  </h3>
	  <p>You can use other published dictionaries as a pattern. The table of contents should be one of the last things you print. In
		 order to get all the page numbers correct, you should draft the table of contents (so you know how long it will be), then
		 print the rest of the book. Then you can insert the correct page numbers into the table of contents.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sFMIntro"></a>4.5.5&nbsp;Introduction
	  </h3>
	  <p>You can use other published dictionaries as a pattern. Give information about the language. Give information about how the
		 dictionary was produced and by whom. Explain the structure and parts of the article. Give credit where credit is due. Remember&#8212;few
		 people will read a long introduction. Keep it short, sweet, and to the point.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sMap"></a>4.5.6&nbsp;Map
	  </h3>
	  <p>Include a map that locates the language area within the country. Also include a large scale map with important towns and geographical
		 features. Mark the boundaries of the language area. Indicate dialect areas and mark dialect boundaries.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sListOfAbbr"></a>4.5.7&nbsp;List of abbreviations
	  </h3>
	  <p>You should maintain a list of abbreviations throughout the length of the project. If you didn&#8217;t keep a list, you will have
		 to search your dictionary for them. Language Explorer maintains several lists of abbreviations in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar</span> area (e.g. <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Categories</span>) and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area (e.g. <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Form Types</span>).
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sOrthGuide"></a>4.5.8&nbsp;Orthography guide
	  </h3>
	  <p>You should include an orthography guide if your language is newly literate. Dictionaries have proven to be a powerful influence
		 on standardizing the orthography, promoting literacy, and developing literature. People will refer to it for the 'correct'
		 way to spell a word.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sFMGrammarSk"></a>4.5.9&nbsp;Grammar sketch
	  </h3>
	  <p>Language Explorer has a tool that will produce a grammar sketch automatically based on the information it gleans from your
		 data in the lexicon and elsewhere in the project. You can generate the grammar sketch in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar--Grammar Sketch</span> area by clicking <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Generate</span>. You can also regenerate it periodically to keep it up to date with the changes you have made to the data. When you regenerate
		 it, Language Explorer overwrites the old file. You can save the grammar sketch in order to edit it outside of Language Explorer
		 prior to publishing. But if you edit it outside of Language Explorer, you cannot update your edited file by having Language
		 Explorer regenerate it. Instead of simply updating the information, Language Explorer deletes the old file and regenerates
		 it. So you would lose all the changes you had typed in.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sFMTables"></a>4.5.10&nbsp;Tables
	  </h3>
	  <p>Some dictionaries include tables for important lexical sets. Alternatively you could include an index of semantic domains.
		 If you only want to include a few lexical sets, consider including tables for the numbers, days of the week, months of the
		 year. If you want to include proper nouns&#8212;personal names, family names, place names&#8212;it saves space to list them in a table
		 rather than including them in the dictionary proper. These materials can also be put after the dictionary proper as appendixes.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sDictProper"></a>4.5.11&nbsp;Dictionary proper
	  </h3>
	  <p>This is where you would put the alphabetized dictionary. You will need to print it and make sure the pagination and headers
		 are correct. Language Explorer currently does not have a fully developed print function. In order to correctly format the
		 dictionary, you might need to export it and print it using another program such as Lexique Pro. (See <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Export</span> in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> files for more on exporting and printing the database.)
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sBMAppendixes"></a>4.5.12&nbsp;Appendixes
	  </h3>
	  <p>An appendix is the same as a table, except that tables are at the beginning of the book and appendixes are at the end. A good
		 rule to follow is to keep tables short. Anything long should be made into an appendix at the end.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sBibliography"></a>4.5.13&nbsp;Bibliography
	  </h3>
	  <p>The bibliography can go at the end of the introduction or at the end of the book, depending on its size. If very little has
		 been published about the language or in the language, list everything. List any previous dictionaries, especially if you referenced
		 them or incorporated them. List any grammars of the language. List any literacy materials, such as a published orthography
		 guide. List language learning materials. List published texts that you used in your text corpus or in example sentences.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sPublisher"></a>4.5.14&nbsp;Finding a publisher
	  </h3>
	  <p>There are several publishing companies that specialize in minority language dictionaries. Look at published dictionaries in
		 your region to see who the publisher was. Often the national university will be interested in publishing a dictionary.
	  </p>
	  <p>Determine how many copies to print. Your publisher should be able to help you decide how many copies to print. Dictionaries
		 tend to sell well. But minority language groups are often too poor to afford a large, well-bound book. On the other hand you
		 may sell lots of copies to university libraries around the world. If your language is large and important for commercial or
		 political reasons, you may sell lots of copies to people needing to communicate in the language. It is better to sell out
		 and have to reprint, than to print too many and go bankrupt.
	  </p>
	  <p>Find a source of funding. Your most likely sources of funding are the national government, international aid organizations,
		 educational institutions, and private foundations. The cheapest way to publish a dictionary is to post it on the Internet.
		 There are a number of websites willing to post minority language dictionaries as part of their collection.
	  </p>
	  <h1 style=""><a name="sTour"></a>5&nbsp;A grand tour of Language Explorer
	  </h1>
	  <p>Language Explorer has a lot of great tools, features, and helps that we don't want you to miss. If you are like me, you like
		 to go exploring on your own. That's fine. Go exploring and have fun. But if you are like me, you also sometimes wish someone
		 would explain some really odd menu item and what it is used for. So if you can't figure something out on your own, come on
		 back and I'll try to explain it.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sGenFeatures"></a>5.1&nbsp;General features
	  </h2>
	  <p>Before we look at specific areas of Language Explorer, let's look at some general features.</p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sMenus"></a>5.1.1&nbsp;Menus and toolbars
	  </h3>
	  <p>In Language Explorer the screen is divided into three basic parts. Along the left of the screen is a list of areas. Across
		 the top are menu bars. The rest of the screen is the work area where you type and do other tasks.
	  </p>
	  <p>There are four major areas of Language Explorer that are listed in the bottom left of the screen--<span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts &amp; Words</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar</span>, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span>. If you click on one of the four areas, you will see in the top left of the screen a list of the views and tools that are
		 available in each of the areas. If you click on one of these views, Language Explorer presents a different work area where
		 you can work on various aspects of your project. I would recommend that you open up each of these work areas to see what is
		 available in Language Explorer. I will explain the purpose of each below.
	  </p>
	  <p>The menu bars across the top of the screen are typical of many software applications. The top line is a series of menus. When
		 you move from area to area in Language Explorer, the list of menus does not change, but the items under each menu change.
		 This is because the menu items are often specific to the area that you are working in. The second menu bar consists of icons
		 and dropdown menus. These also change when you switch to a different area.
	  </p>
	  <p>There are also other menus that are specific to a particular pane or field in one of the work areas. These can be accessed
		 by clicking on the menu icons that look like this <img src="menuicon down blue arrow.jpg"> or this <img src="menuicon down white arrow 2.jpg">. Some of these menu icons only appear when you click on the field. You can also open the menus by right clicking on the line
		 or the field name.
	  </p>
	  <p>Occasionally you will use one of the menus to change a setting in Language Explorer, but nothing happens. This is actually
		 a problem with the program. The first thing you should try is to click the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Refresh the screen</span> icon <img src="menuicon refresh.jpg" alt=""> on the menu bar at the top. Often this will cause Language Explorer to implement the change.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sViewData"></a>5.1.2&nbsp;Multiple views of the data
	  </h3>
	  <p>It is important to be able to view your data in many different ways. For instance you may want to see what an entry will actually
		 look like in print. So the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span> view includes a <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary Preview</span> pane. You can see how the entire dictionary will look in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span> view. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Indexes</span> view enables you to see how a reversal index will look. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Classified Dictionary</span> view enables you to see how the dictionary will print as a semantically classified dictionary or thesaurus. It is important
		 to note that these are not actually print previews. You can print these views, but they will not be photo ready copy for a
		 proper publication. Language Explorer does not yet have proper typesetting functions. These views do, however, give a preview
		 of what the data can look like after proper typesetting. They also show how entries are structured for export to other software.
		 For more on exporting your data see section <a href="#sExportData">4.4.6</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>You may also want to view a number of entries at one time with each field in a separate column in a table format. This kind
		 of view is called a browse view. A browse view is included in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span> tool. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Browse</span> pane consists of a browse view in which you can directly edit many fields. In addition the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools use a browse view. These browse views are especially useful when you are working on a particular field. The browse
		 views allow you to pick the columns you want to see, and arrange, size, sort, and filter them. (For more on the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Browse</span> pane see the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> topic 'Lexicon Browse overview'.)
	  </p>
	  <p>Typically in a browse view each row displays a different entry and each column displays a different field. This works fine
		 as long as each field only occurs once in an entry. For instance most of the entry level fields only occur once per entry.
		 But many other fields can occur more than once in an entry. For this reason the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries</span> tool will change the way your data is presented depending on which field you want to edit. For instance if you want to edit
		 the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field, it will place each citation form on a separate line. This has the effect of displaying each entry on a single line.
		 But if you want to edit the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Example</span> field, it will place each example sentence on a separate line. Since there may be several example sentences in an entry,
		 this means that the entry level fields will be duplicated for each example sentence. In this way you can see and edit each
		 occurrence of the field you are editing, but also see the other fields in the entry. (For more on data views see section <a href="#sDataVsPresent">2.2.3</a>. For more on the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools see the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> topic 'Bulk Edit Entries overview'.)
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sSortData"></a>5.1.3&nbsp;Sorting
	  </h3>
	  <p>Most dictionaries are organized by sorting the headword. However you may sometimes want to view the data by sorting on a different
		 field. Language Explorer enables you to sort on any field in a browse view. You can sort top to bottom, or bottom to top.
		 You can sort left to right, or right to left. You can set up special sort orders for each language in the database. You can
		 change the sort order in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary View</span> by changing the vernacular language sort order. (For more on sorting see the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> file topic 'Sort data'.)
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sFilterData"></a>5.1.4&nbsp;Filtering
	  </h3>
	  <p>Sometimes you want to concentrate on just one type of data, for instance on nouns. The browse views enable you to filter on
		 any field. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Filter</span> dialog box has a number of simple options that are easy to use and will enable you to filter for many kinds of data. However
		 Language Explorer also enables you to use regular expressions (a powerful computer language) for very complicated filters.
		 It may take some effort to learn how to use regular expressions, but they will enable you to filter your data in many more
		 ways. (For more on filtering see the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> file topic 'Filtering data overview'.)
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sTypesOfFields"></a>5.1.5&nbsp;Types of fields
	  </h3>
	  <p>There are six types of fields in Language Explorer:</p>
	  <ul>
		 <li>Vernacular text fields. Examples are the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Example</span> (sentence) field. You can embed analysis language text in a vernacular field if you need to. If you set up more than one
			vernacular writing system, each field will have a separate line for each writing system. Generally you would type the contents
			of a text field directly into the field.
		 </li>
		 <li>Analysis language text fields. Examples are the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field. You can embed vernacular text in an analysis language field if you need to. If you set up more than one analysis language,
			each field will have a separate line for each analysis language.
		 </li>
		 <li>Virtual fields. Examples is the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense Number</span> field. You cannot enter data in these fields. Language Explorer automatically fills in these fields on the basis of other
			fields. For instance the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field is identical to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field. But when there is nothing in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field, Language Explorer uses the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field to fill in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field. So you cannot directly edit the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field. To change the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field, you have to change the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field or the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field.
		 </li>
		 <li>List fields. An example is the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Category</span> field. The contents of these fields are chosen from an authority list. The authority lists are maintained by you in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar</span> area or the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area. The purpose of a list field is to restrict the contents of the field to a limited set of values. This helps to keep
			the contents consistent. For instance, instead of typing something like 'noun' into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Category</span> field, you must choose the correct item from the list. This prevents you from typing 'noun' one time, 'n' a different time,
			and 'n.' another time. If you decide that you would rather abbreviate 'noun' with a capital 'N', you can change it in the
			<span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar--Category Edit</span> area. All you have to do is change what is in the abbreviation field and it will be changed everywhere in your dictionary.
			The same is true of all the lists that the program maintains in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar</span> area and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area. You can edit any of these lists to customize your dictionary.
		 </li>
		 <li>Cross-reference fields. An example is the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field. These fields link the current entry (or sense) to another entry (or sense of an entry).
		 </li>
		 <li>Check box fields. An example is the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Exclude As Headword</span> field. These fields consist of a check box <img src="menuicon check box field.jpg"> that turns a feature on or off.

	  <h2 style=""><a name="sLexicon"></a>5.2&nbsp;Lexicon
	  </h2>
	  <p>The Lexicon area is where you create, edit, and manage your dictionary database, which is called the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon</span> in Language Explorer. You also use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon</span> area to generate various publications based on your database.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sLexEdit"></a>5.2.1&nbsp;Lexicon Edit
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span> area is where you create and edit particular lexemes. The area is divided into three panes. On the left is the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entries</span> pane, which is a browse view. You can edit some of the fields in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entries</span> pane, but not others. If you click on one of the rows, the blue fields cannot be edited, but the white fields can. You can
		 only edit the simple text fields. (However you can edit almost every field using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries</span> area, which is also a browse view.) The primary purpose of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entries</span> pane is to help you to sort and filter your database to find those entries that you want to work on. You can show any field
		 in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entries</span> pane by clicking on the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure which columns to display</span> icon <img src="menuicon configure columns.jpg"> in the top right corner of the pane. If a field is being displayed, you can sort the database on it by clicking on the header
		 line at the top of the column. The column that is currently being sorted on will have a blue arrow next to it <img src="menuicon sort column.jpg">. (For more on sorting see the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> file topic 'Sort data'.) You can also filter the database by filtering the data in a particular field. You access the filter
		 menu by clicking on the dropdown menu icon <img src="menuicon show all.jpg"> in the second line at the top of the column. Different columns permit different kinds of filters. So this menu may change
		 depending on the type of field. (For more on filtering see the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> file topic 'Filter data'.)
	  </p>
	  <p>On the right is the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane. At the top is a pane that gives you a preview of how the entry might look in print. You can configure how your dictionary
		 will look by using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Dictionary</span> tool that is accessed under <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools</span> on the menu bar.
	  </p>
	  <p>The bottom part of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane displays a single entry with each field on a separate line. You can edit each field in this pane.
	  </p>
	  <p>If you are not using a field, you can choose to hide it by clicking on the field, clicking on the <img src="menuicon down white arrow 2.jpg"> icon, clicking <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Field Visibility</span>, and then selecting one of the options. When you click on the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Show Hidden Fields</span> icon at the top of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane, Language Explorer will hide the fields that you are not using. When the check box is unchecked and looks like this
		 <img src="menuicon show hidden fields off.jpg">, some of the fields are hidden. When the check box is checked and looks like this <img src="menuicon show hidden fields on.jpg">, all of the fields are visible, even the ones you are not using. For a description of each of the fields in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane see section <a href="#sDescFields">6.2</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sBrowse"></a>5.2.2&nbsp;Browse
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Browse</span> area consists of a single browse view of the lexicon with each entry on a separate line and each field in a separate column.
		 As with the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entries</span> pane in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span>, you can only edit the text fields. You can sort on any field. If you sort on a field that occurs more than once in an entry,
		 each instance of that field will be put on a separate line. This results in the entry being split up. You can also filter
		 each field.
	  </p>
	  <p>The advantage of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Browse</span> area is that you can use the entire screen. This enables you to see many entries and fields simultaneously. The primary disadvantage
		 of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Browse</span> area is that you cannot edit efficiently, which is why we have the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> areas.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sDictionary"></a>5.2.3&nbsp;Dictionary
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span> area presents your lexicon formatted as an alphabetized dictionary. You can change how it is formatted using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Dictionary</span> tool that can be accessed from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools</span> menu. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Dictionary</span> tool allows you to choose various formats, choose which fields to include, order your fields, format particular fields using
		 styles, add punctuation before or after a field, etc. In this way you can get your dictionary to look just the way you want
		 it. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span> area also allows you to proofread your dictionary prior to publication.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sCollectWords"></a>5.2.4&nbsp;Collect Words
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span> area allows you to efficiently type words that were collected during a Rapid Word Colletion (RWC) workshop. (Rapid Word Collection
		 is the first step in the larger Dictionary Development Process (DDP), which is the method described in this paper.) You can
		 learn more about the RWC method of collecting words by visiting the RWC website (<a href="http://rapidwords.net/">http://rapidwords.net/</a>). You can download the RWC materials and instructions for how to use them from the website. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span> area consists of the DDP semantic domains. The list of domains is displayed in the column on the left. Each domain consists
		 of a short description and a series of elicitation questions with example words. The description and questions are displayed
		 on the top right. Below this is a place where you can type the vernacular words that belong to the domain together with a
		 short gloss or definition.
	  </p>
	  <p>As you type words into this area, Language Explorer creates a new entry for each one in your lexicon. The word entry area
		 is a browse view. So you have the ability to add columns to the display. The default view only shows two columns--the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word (Citation Form)</span> column and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Meaning (Definition)</span> column. The form you type into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word (Citation Form)</span> column goes into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field. What you type in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Meaning (Definition)</span> column goes into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field. You can use the icon <img src="menuicon configure columns.jpg"> in the top right corner to change which columns are displayed in the browse view. For instance if you want to enter the lexeme
		 form of the word instead of the citation form, you can replace the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word (Citation Form)</span> column with the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word (Lexeme Form)</span> column. Likewise, if you want to enter a gloss instead of a definition, you can replace the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Meaning (Definition)</span> column with the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Meaning (Gloss)</span> column.
	  </p>
	  <p>Notice that the four columns--<span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word (Citation Form)</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word (Lexeme Form)</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Meaning (Definition)</span>, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Meaning (Gloss)</span>--are not the same as their respective fields. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Meaning (Definition)</span> column displays the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field. But if you have not entered a definition, it will display the contents of the the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field in parentheses.
	  </p>
	  <p>Each word you type is also assigned to the current semantic domain. However if the word you type matches an existing lexeme
		 in your lexicon, Language Explorer merely adds a new sense to the entry and assigns the sense to the current semantic domain
		 in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Semantic Domain</span> field. However if both the lexeme and definition match what is in your lexicon, Language Explorer merely adds the current
		 semantic domain to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Semantic Domain</span> field in the respective sense.
	  </p>
	  <p><span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span> works well when you are just starting your project. However if you already have a large dictionary, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span> will very likely add lots of duplicate senses to your lexicon. This can result in a lot of extra work to merge the duplicate
		 senses. One way around this problem is to first classify all existing senses in your dictionary. Then when you use <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span>, all the existing words in a domain will already be displayed. Unfortunately there is not an easy way to classify existing
		 senses. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Semantic Domain</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span> <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> area has a tool in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Choose Semantic Domains</span> dialog box called <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Suggest</span>. It will suggest possible semantic domains for the word, based on what you have entered in the the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field.<span style="font-size:65%; vertical-align:super">[<a href="#nAutoClassify">9</a>]</span></p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sClassifiedDict"></a>5.2.5&nbsp;Classified Dictionary
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Classified Dictionary</span> area displays your lexicon as a semantically classified dictionary using the list of semantic domains in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Semantic Domain</span> field. The display consists of each semantic domain and a list of all the lexemes that belong to the domain. Each lexeme
		 is followed by the relevant sense number and the definition from the sense.
	  </p>
	  <p>If you have not classified any of your lexemes by semantic domains, there will be nothing in this area. So to use this feature,
		 you must first classify your lexemes. The easiest way to do this is to use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span> area to think of all the words that belong to each domain.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Semantic Domain</span> field is a sense level field. A lexeme may have several senses, but only one of those senses may be relevant to a particular
		 semantic domain. The other senses may belong to other domains. So the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Classified Dictionary</span> area displays each sense under its own domain. If a sense is not classified under any domain, it will not be displayed anywhere
		 in the classified dictionary.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sBulkEditEntries"></a>5.2.6&nbsp;Bulk Edit Entries
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries</span> area contains a number of tools to help you efficiently fill in and edit fields. These tools enable you to work on a particular
		 field in every entry in your lexicon. The top part of the area consists of a browse view with each entry on a line and each
		 field in a separate column. The bottom part of the area consists of six tools. The tools can be found on the six tabs at the
		 bottom. When you click on one of these tabs, the bottom of the area changes to display the options that you need to choose
		 in order to use the tool.
	  </p>
	  <p>Much of the work involved in developing a lexical database is repetitive. The team that developed Language Explorer carefully
		 thought through the kinds of editing functions that lexicographers need to perform and developed the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools to make these tasks easy. The sections below explain each of the tools and how to use them. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools can help you accomplish many tasks in a fraction of the time that it would take you to do the task in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span>. Using these tools can save you months of tedious typing.
	  </p>
	  <p>The top part of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries</span> area consists of a browse view of the lexicon, but there are a few special features that you need to be aware of. In order
		 for you to work on a field, that field needs to be displayed in one of the columns. You can choose which fields are displayed
		 by clicking the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure which columns to display</span> <img src="menuicon configure columns.jpg"> icon in the top right corner of the pane. This will display a list of fields that are available. If you don't see the field
		 that you need in the list, click the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">More Column Choices</span> option at the bottom. This will bring up a dialog box where you can choose which fields you want to display, change their
		 order, see which ones can be bulk edited, and (if you have set up more than one writing system or analysis language) choose
		 which writing system should be used in the field. This gives you good control over what fields you see.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can choose to sort on any field by clicking the field name at the top of the column. The field that is currently being
		 used to sort the lexicon will have a blue triangle next to it that looks like this <img src="menuicon sort column.jpg">. You can do a secondary sort on a second field by holding down the Shift key and clicking the field name. A small blue triangle
		 will appear next to the second field name. If you right click on a field name, you can choose to sort the field from the end
		 (right to left) or by the length of the field contents. (For more on sorting see the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> file topic 'Sort data'.)
	  </p>
	  <p>You can filter the contents of a field by clicking on the dropdown menu icon <img src="menuicon show all.jpg"> in the second line at the top of the column. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Show All</span> option turns off the filter. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Blanks</span> option filters for fields that are empty. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Non-Blanks</span> option filters out fields that are empty. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Filter for</span> option enables you to filter for a string of characters. This option also permits you to use regular expressions. Regular
		 expressions are special codes used by computer programmers that enable you to filter for complex kinds of things such as consonants,
		 vowels, and single words. Different kinds of fields permit different kinds of filters. For instance a list field has an additional
		 option <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Choose</span> that enables you to filter for one or more items in the list. You can also filter out items. A check box field has "yes"
		 and "no" options. (For more on filtering see the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> file topic 'Filter data'.)
	  </p>
	  <p>On the left is a column of check boxes. In order for a change to be made to an entry, there must be a check <img src="menuicon check box BE.jpg"> in that row. The check box icon <img src="menuicon check box blue.jpg"> at the top of the column has three options. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Check All</span> option puts a check mark in each row. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Uncheck All</span> option removes all the check marks. If you have some of the boxes checked and then select the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Toggle</span> option, all the checked boxes will become unchecked and all the unchecked boxes will become checked.
	  </p>
	  <p>Using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sort</span> feature, the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Filter</span> feature, and the check boxes enables you to focus on any subset of the data that you want to work on and make changes to
		 just those fields and entries that you want to change.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sListChoice"></a>5.2.6.1&nbsp;List Choice
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">List Choice</span> tool enables you to work on a list field. The contents of a list field are chosen from an authority list. These lists are
		 maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area or the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar</span> area. You cannot type in a list field. Instead you choose one of the items in the authority list. That is why this tool is
		 call <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">List Choice</span>--because you choose an item from a list. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">List Choice</span> tool is the only one that works on list fields. The other <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools work on text fields.
	  </p>
	  <p>To use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">List Choice</span> tool you must first specify which field you want work on in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Target Field</span> box. The field must be showing in one of the columns. In the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Change To</span> box you choose which item in the list you want. Click <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Preview</span> to see what changes will be made. If you are happy with your choices, click <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Apply</span> to make the changes permanent. (You can always click <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Undo</span> to reverse the changes. But if you leave the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> area, you can no longer reverse the changes using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Undo</span> icon.)
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">List Choice</span> tool is especially useful for filling in (or changing) the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Category</span> field, the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Class</span> field, and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Features</span> field. You would also use it to change check box fields like the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Exclude As Headword</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sBulkCopy"></a>5.2.6.2&nbsp;Bulk Copy
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Copy</span> tool copies the contents of the source field into the target field. Both fields must be showing. There are three options
		 in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">If the Target field is not empty</span> box that give you control over what happens when there is already something in the target field.
	  </p>
	  <p>The Bulk Copy tool is especially useful for filling in a field that is very similar in content to another field. For instance
		 you could copy the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field and then modify one or the other.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sClickCopy"></a>5.2.6.3&nbsp;Click Copy
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Click Copy</span> tool was designed to copy a single word from one field into another field. The basic idea is to click on a word in one field
		 and have that word copied into another field. There are several options. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">String, reordered at word clicked</span> option enables you to copy more than just one word. There are also two options that give you control over what happens when
		 there is already something in the target field.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Click Copy</span> tool is especially useful for filling in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field by clicking on a word in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field. You can also use it to fill in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Entries</span> field by clicking on a word in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sProcess"></a>5.2.6.4&nbsp;Process
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Process</span> tool was designed to enable those with good computer skills to use advanced tools like CC tables, ICU transducers, TECkit
		 files, and Regular Expressions to modify the contents of a field.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Process</span> tool is especially useful for transforming writing systems. For instance you could use it to update your orthography. You
		 could also use it to transform the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field into an IPA phonetic transcription in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field. The power of the advanced tools make it possible to make a wide variety of changes to a field.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sBulkReplace"></a>5.2.6.5&nbsp;Bulk Replace
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Replace</span> tool functions much the same as the "Find and Replace" or "Replace" tools found in many word processors. It was designed
		 to allow you to make a single change to a field. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Setup</span> button opens up a dialog box that has a number of useful options. You can also use regular expressions to make complicated
		 changes or to condition the change you want to make.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Replace</span> tool has many applications. You can use it to make a single change to your orthography. You can add an affix to a vernacular
		 form or delete the affix. You can replace a space in your <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field with a period or an underscore character. If you have any systematic change that needs to be made, you can use <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Replace</span> to do it.
	  </p>
	  <p>To add a prefix to a form, type a caret (^) in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Find what:</span> box and click <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Use Regular Expressions</span>. (The caret (^) is the regular expression symbol that represents the beginning of the word.) Then type the prefix in the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Replace with</span> box.
	  </p>
	  <p>To add a suffix, type a dollar sign ($) in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Find what:</span> box and click <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Use Regular Expressions</span>. (The dollar sign ($) is the regular expression symbol that represents the end of the word.) Then type the suffix in the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Replace with:</span> box.
	  </p>
	  <p>To add something to an empty field, type ^$ in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Find what:</span> box and click <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Use Regular Expressions</span>. The caret (^) finds the beginning of the field and the dollar sign ($) finds the end of the field. So the regular expression
		 means "find a field in which the beginning of the field is followed by the end of the field." In other words, find a field
		 in which there is nothing between the beginning of the field and the end. Then in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Replace with:</span> box type whatever you want to add to the empty field.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sDelete"></a>5.2.6.6&nbsp;Delete
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Delete</span> tool was designed to delete the contents of a field or to delete whole entries. You can also use it to delete senses. You
		 should use this tool with extreme caution because it will delete data from your database. I would recommend that you make
		 a backup of your project before using it.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Delete</span> tool is especially useful when you are trying to fill in a field using one of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools, but you made a mistake in the process and the results are not correct. You can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Delete</span> tool to delete the contents of the field and start over again. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Delete</span> tool is also useful for deleting duplicate senses and entries. This sometimes happens when you merge two dictionaries.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sReversalIndex"></a>5.2.7&nbsp;Reversal Indexes
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Indexes</span> area (and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Reversal Entries</span> area) are designed to help you produce a reversal index for a bilingual dictionary. If you have more than one analysis language,
		 you can produce an index for each one.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Indexes</span> area has two panes. On the left the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Index</span> pane shows how the reversal index might look in print. On the right the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Entry</span> pane enables you to edit a single index entry.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can choose what fields to include in the index by using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Reversal Index</span> tool found under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools</span> menu. In Language Explorer a reversal index entry consists of three fields. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Form</span> field is the analysis language form that you gave in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Entries</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span> area. So the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Form</span> field and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Entries</span> field are really the same thing.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category</span> field is intended to be the category of the analysis language word, not the vernacular word. If the analysis language form
		 is not a single word, you should not give any grammatical category for it. If it is an idiom, you might want to considering
		 labeling it as such. But some forms will simply be a description of the meaning of the vernacular word. It would be misleading
		 to give a grammatical category for something that is essentially a definition. You should be especially careful when the grammatical
		 category of the analysis language form and the vernacular form do not match. Because of these difficulties, most dictionaries
		 avoid the whole problem by not even giving the grammatical category of the analysis language form. After all, the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Index</span> is an index to the dictionary, not a dictionary itself. However some users appreciate knowing the grammatical category of
		 the analysis language forms. This is especially true of speakers of the vernacular who want to use your dictionary to learn
		 the analysis language.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Senses</span> field is a virtual field that is automatically generated by Language Explorer. It is essentially a cross-reference to a sense
		 of an entry in the lexicon. You can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Reversal Index</span> tool to specify what will be included in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Senses</span> field. Language Explorer can include any of the fields from the lexicon in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Senses</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can use the reversal index system to produce a simple index (also known as a "finder list") or to draft an analysis language-vernacular
		 dictionary. Language Explorer is not designed to handle both sides of a vernacular-analysis and analysis-vernacular pair of
		 dictionaries. To do an adequate job of producing both dictionaries, you would need to set up two separate projects.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sBulkEditRevEnt"></a>5.2.8&nbsp;Bulk Edit Reversal Entries
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Reversal Entries</span> area is like the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries</span> area, except that you would use it to make systematic changes to reversal entries. Reversal entries only have three fields--<span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Form</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category</span>, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Senses</span>. You use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">List Choice</span> tool to fill in or edit the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category</span> field, since it is a list field. You use the other tools to edit the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Form</span> field. You cannot edit the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Senses</span> field, since it is a virtual field that is automatically generated by Language Explorer.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sTextsWords"></a>5.3&nbsp;Texts &amp; Words
	  </h2>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts &amp; Words</span> area is designed to help you analyze texts and the words in them. It has three primary purposes:
	  </p>
	  <ol style="list-style-type:decimal; ">
		 <li>Interlinearize texts.</li>
		 <li>Analyze the morphology of the language.</li>
		 <li>Use the text corpus method to study the lexicon and grammar of the language, including the discourse structure of texts.</li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>The five sub-areas in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts &amp; Words</span> area display your textual data in various ways and help you accomplish specific tasks.
	  </p>
	  <p>In addition to the five sub-areas, there is also a parser that can be accessed from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Parser</span> menu. If you want to use the parser to help you analyze words, you must first turn it on. There is also a spell-checker available
		 under <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools--Spelling</span>.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sInterlinearTexts"></a>5.3.1&nbsp;Interlinear Texts
	  </h3>
	  <p>The Interlinear Texts area is designed to enable you to create a text corpus and to interlinearize the texts. The area consists
		 of two panes. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts</span> pane on the left is a list of the texts in your text corpus. You can add a new text to the corpus by clicking the <img src="menuicon add text.jpg"> icon on the toolbar.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Text</span> pane on the right is where you work on a particular text. At the top is a box where you enter the title of the text. Below
		 this is a series of seven tabs that represent various views and tools.
	  </p>
	  <ol style="list-style-type:decimal; ">
		 <li><span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Info</span>. This tab is used to provide metadata about the text, including the author and genre of the text.
		 </li>
		 <li><span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Baseline</span>. This tab contains just the text itself. Once you have created a new blank text, you can type the text here or cut and paste
			it in from another application. You should be careful about cutting and pasting texts. Some programs (such as Microsoft Publisher,
			Unix/Linux, and CygWin) will sometimes insert a single Line Feed (0x00A) that will disrupt the display of the text in Language
			Explorer.
		 </li>
		 <li><span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span>. This tab enables you to supply an analysis language gloss for each wordform. This is useful if you do not want to analyze
			the morphology of each wordform.
		 </li>
		 <li><span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Analyze</span>. This tab enables you to fully interlinearize the text by dividing each word into morphemes and labeling each morpheme. You
			can decide which rows to display by using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Interlinear</span> tool available under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools</span> menu. Language Explorer also has a built-in parser that you can turn on under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Parser</span> menu. The parser will propose an analysis based on the information you provide in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon</span> and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar</span> areas.
		 </li>
		 <li><span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tagging</span>. This tab enables you to add various kinds of syntactic tags to indicate the syntactic structure of the text. You can tag
			a single word or a stretch of text. The tags are chosen from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Text Markup Tags</span> list in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area.
		 </li>
		 <li><span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Print View</span>. This tab presents the text as it might appear in print. You can choose which rows to include by using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Interlinear</span> tool available under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools</span> menu.
		 </li>
		 <li><span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Text Chart</span>. This tab enables you to chart a text by setting up a series of columns for each sentence constituent. You set up the columns
			in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Text Constituent Chart Templates</span> list in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area. Each item in the list corresponds to a column in your chart. The list is hierarchical, which enables you to set up
			major columns and minor columns within the major columns.
		 </li>
	  </ol>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sConcordane"></a>5.3.2&nbsp;Concordance
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Concordance</span> area enables you to generate a concordance of a wordform from your text corpus. If you have interlinearized your texts, you
		 can search any line for any wordform, allomorph, lexeme, or gloss. You specify what you want to find in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Specify Concordance Criteria</span> pane at the top left. The concordance entries are displayed in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Concordance Results</span> pane at the bottom left. You can look at the larger context in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Full Context</span> pane on the right.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sWordListConc"></a>5.3.3&nbsp;Word List Concordance
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word List Concordance</span> area is similar to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Concordance</span> area, except that it is limited to generating a concordance of wordforms. You cannot use it to search for other kinds of
		 forms. For instance you cannot use it to generate a concordance of a lexeme in order to see all the inflected forms of the
		 lexeme. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Wordforms</span> pane consists of a list of all the wordforms in your corpus. It is a browse view, which enables you to sort and filter on
		 various fields in order to narrow your search. For instance one of the available fields is the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Number in Corpus</span> field that gives the number of times the wordform occurs in the corpus. By sorting on this field you can investigate the
		 most frequent words first.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sWordAnalyses"></a>5.3.4&nbsp;Word Analyses
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word Analyses</span> area enables you to see all the analyses that you have given while interlinearizing texts and the analyses proposed by the
		 parser. The ones that you have approved come first. This area also enables you to approve or disapprove of analyses. If the
		 correct analysis is not displayed, you can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Parse Current Word</span> tool under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Parser</span> menu to find out why.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sBulkEditWord"></a>5.3.5&nbsp;Bulk Edit Wordforms
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Wordforms</span> area allows you to use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools on the list of wordforms found in your corpus. The only two fields that you can edit are the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Form</span> field and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Spelling Status</span> field. You can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">List Choice</span> tab to efficiently change the spelling status of your wordforms so that the spell checking tool will either approve of a
		 spelling or flag it as misspelled.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sGrammar"></a>5.4&nbsp;Grammar
	  </h2>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar</span> area is where you specify various aspects of your grammar. Most of the sub-areas are used by the interlinearizer and parser,
		 but a few are used in your lexicon.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sCategoryEdit"></a>5.4.1&nbsp;Category Edit
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category Edit</span> area is where you list the grammatical categories that are used in your language. This list is used in several places in
		 Language Explorer, including the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Category</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon</span>. It is also used in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts &amp; Words</span> area in the interlinear display in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lex. Gram. Info</span> line and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word Cat.</span> line.
	  </p>
	  <p>Grammatical category used to be called 'part of speech' and still is by some linguists. But the term 'grammatical category'
		 is more descriptive of the phenomenon. A grammatical category is a group of words that all function in the grammar in similar
		 ways. Grammatical categories often have subcategories of words that behave in different ways. It is also helpful to remember
		 that some members of a category may behave in special ways morphologically, while others behave in special ways syntactically.
	  </p>
	  <p>Each grammatical category in the list has a section for <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Affix Slots</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Class Info</span>, (Inflection) <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Features</span>, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Stem Names</span>. These sections enable you to specify how the category members behave morphologically. The sections were designed to be used
		 by the parser, but some dictionaries also include this information in the dictionary article to help users know how to inflect
		 words.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sCategoriesBrws"></a>5.4.2&nbsp;Categories Browse
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Categories Browse</span> area is merely a browse view of the data in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category Edit</span> area. You cannot edit in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Categories Browse</span> area. So it is of limited usefulness except to line up each field in order to check for consistency.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sCompoundRules"></a>5.4.3&nbsp;Compound Rules
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Compound Rules</span> area enables you to list patterns of compounding for use by the parser. You need to do this if you want the parser to parse
		 down to the root level. This area is not used by the lexicon. For more on compound rules see <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Introduction to Parsing</span> under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> menu.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sPhonemes"></a>5.4.4&nbsp;Phonemes
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Phonemes</span> area enables you to list all the phonemes in your language and all the orthographic representations of each phoneme. This
		 is especially important if a phoneme has more than one orthographic representation. For instance in English the phoneme /k/
		 can be spelled 'c' or 'k' as in <span style="color:#0000ff; ">cat</span> or <span style="color:#0000ff; ">kitten</span>. Once you have listed your phonemes, they can be used in environments in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Environments</span> area. This area is not used by the lexicon. For more on phonemes see <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Introduction to Parsing</span> under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> menu.

	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Natural Classes</span> area enables you to list the natural classes of phonemes in your language. Once you have created an entry for a natural class,
		 it can be used in environments in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Environments</span> area. This area is not used by the lexicon.

	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Environments</span> area enables you to list various environments that constrain allomorphs. You use environments to constrain allomorphs in
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span> in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Allomorphs</span> section of the entry.

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sGrammarSketch"></a>5.4.12&nbsp;Grammar Sketch
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar Sketch</span> is a tool that will automatically draft a grammar sketch of your language based on the information that you have given in
		 various places in Language Explorer. The tool gleans information from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon</span> area, the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar</span> area, and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area. It uses a template and inserts the information it has gleaned into sections of the template. You can regenerate the
		 grammar sketch periodically. Each time you regenerate the grammar sketch, Language Explorer updates all the information it
		 has collected. It overwrites the old grammar sketch. You can edit the grammar sketch, but if you do, you should save the file
		 to a different name. Otherwise Language Explorer will overwrite your changes the next time it regenerates the grammar sketch.
		 The best strategy is to refrain from making any changes to the file until you are ready to publish it. At that point you should
		 regenerate the sketch and save it to another name.
	  </p>
	  <p>One purpose of the grammar sketch is to indicate residue and other problems with your project. You should periodically regenerate
		 the sketch and check it for problems that need to be fixed.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sProblems"></a>5.4.13&nbsp;Problems

	  <p>This <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Problems</span> area lists problems with the environments you have created in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Environments</span> area. If you create an environment that is not well-formed, Language Explorer will copy it into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Problems</span> area and generate an error report that explains what the problem is. The environment is copied into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Records</span> column and the error report is placed in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Problem Report</span> column. This enables you to diagnose the problem and fix it. Once you have fixed the problem, you should delete the record
		 with its problem report.

	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area consists of a series of authority lists. These lists are used in various places in Language Explorer, mostly in the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon</span>, but in other places too. Each list field in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span> corresponds to a list either in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar</span> area or the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area. For instance the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Semantic Domains</span> field in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span> is chosen from a list of semantic domains. That list is maintained here. The lists are also used throughout the FieldWorks
		 suite of programs. Some of the lists are used much more frequently in other applications, such as Data Notebook, and have
		 limited usefulness in Language Explorer.

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sAcademicDom"></a>5.5.1&nbsp;Academic Domains
	  </h3>
	  <p>This list is used in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Academic Domains</span> field in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span>. For more on using academic domains see section <a href="#sAcadDomFi">6.2.2.21</a>.

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sAnthroCat"></a>5.5.2&nbsp;Anthropology Categories
	  </h3>
	  <p>This list is used in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Anthropology Categories</span> field in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span>. It is a sense level field and is used to classify a sense of a word that is relevant to some topic in anthropology. The
		 list is the famous Outline of Cultural Materials (OCM), also known as the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF). It was originally
		 developed by anthropologists as a system for filing field notes.<span style="font-size:65%; vertical-align:super">[<a href="#nAnthCat">10</a>]</span></p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sComplexFormT"></a>5.5.3&nbsp;Complex Form Types
	  </h3>
	  <p>This list is used in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Form Type</span> field in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span>. It is an entry level field and is used to label different kinds of complex forms. A complex form is a lexeme that consists
		 of more than one morpheme. If a lexeme is a complex form, you should indicate what type it is using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Form Type</span> field. Language Explorer uses this field to help the parser analyze words and phrases. It also uses it to format your printed
		 dictionary. If you have been using Language Explorer for some time, you will recognize that this list partially replaces the
		 old Entry Type list. (The other Entry Types are handled by the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Types</span> list.)
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sConfidenceLvl"></a>5.5.4&nbsp;Confidence Levels
	  </h3>
	  <p>This list is used in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Confidence</span> field in some of the lists in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area. If you add an item to one of these lists, you can indicate how confident you are of its validity.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sTextChartMrkrs"></a>5.5.5&nbsp;Text Chart Markers
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Text Chart Markers</span> list is used in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts &amp; Words--Interlinear Texts--Text Chart</span> area. If you move the cursor over one of the cells in the chart, a blue menu arrow <img src="menuicon down white arrow 2.jpg" alt=""> appears. If you click on the blue menu arrow, you can select one of the items from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Text Chart Markers</span> list and it will be added as an annotation to that cell. For instance if a verb tense has more than one discourse function,
		 you can list each function in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Text Chart Markers</span> list. Then in your text chart you can specify the function of the tense of a particular verb by selecting the appropriate
		 list item from the menu.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sTextConstChTem"></a>5.5.6&nbsp;Text Constituent Chart Templates
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Text Constituent Chart Templates</span> list enables you to create a set of columns to use in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts &amp; Words--Interlinear Texts--Text Chart</span> area. Each item in this list corresponds to a column in your text charts. The list is hierarchical, so you can create major
		 columns and sub-columns within each major column. You can only create one template.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sEducationLevels"></a>5.5.7&nbsp;Education Levels
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Education Levels</span> list enables you to create a list of education levels. It corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Education</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">People</span> list. You would use it to indicate the education level of each person in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">People</span> list.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sFeatureTypes"></a>5.5.8&nbsp;Feature Types
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Feature Types</span> list is used by the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Features</span> list in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar</span> area. It is not used in the lexicon. For more on feature types see <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Introduction to Parsing</span> under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> menu.

	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Genres</span> list enables you to list the various kinds of text genres in your text corpus. You use this list in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts &amp; Words--Interlinear Texts--Information</span> tab. It corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Genres</span> field there.

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sLexicalRel"></a>5.5.10&nbsp;Lexical Relations
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> list enables you to create a list of lexical relations that you want to use to cross-reference entries in your dictionary.
		 The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> list is used by two fields in the lexicon--the entry level <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Cross References</span> field, and the sense level <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sLocations"></a>5.5.11&nbsp;Locations
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Locations</span> list enables you to create a list of locations in your language area. For instance you can list dialects, districts, or towns.
		 The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Locations</span> list corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Place of Birth</span> and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Place of Residence</span> fields in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">People</span> list. You would use it to indicate the birthplace and current home of each person in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">People</span> list.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sMorphemeTypes"></a>5.5.12&nbsp;Morpheme Types
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morpheme Types</span> list contains a list of all the types of morphemes that have been identified by linguists. You cannot edit this list, since
		 it is considered to be a complete listing of all possible morpheme types. It correspond to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph (Morpheme) Type</span> field in the lexicon.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sPeople"></a>5.5.13&nbsp;People
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">People</span> list enables you to create a list of people that are involved in your project. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">People</span> list corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Researchers</span> field in many of the other lists in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area, such as the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Academic Domain</span> list and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Anthropology Categories</span> list. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">People</span> list is not used in the lexicon.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sPositions"></a>5.5.14&nbsp;Positions
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Positions</span> list enables you to create a list of professional positions in your project, such as Editor, Consultant, or Researcher. It
		 corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Positions</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">People</span> list. You would use it to indicate the role each person in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">People</span> list has in your project.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sRestrictions"></a>5.5.15&nbsp;Restrictions
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Restrictions</span> list enables you to create a list of restrictions on your data. From the default values it appears that the values relate
		 to publishing concerns. However this list is only used in other lists and it would be highly unlikely that anyone would ever
		 publish any of the lists. So it is unclear (to me) why anyone would use this list. It is not used in the lexicon. This list
		 corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Restrictions</span> field in many of the lists in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area.
	  </p>
	  <p>This list should not be confused with the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Restrictions</span> field in the lexicon. The two are not related.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sSemanticDom"></a>5.5.16&nbsp;Semantic Domains
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Semantic Domains</span> list enables you to create a list of semantic domains that you can use to classify the lexemes in your dictionary. The list
		 corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Semantic Domains</span> field in the lexicon. The list of semantic domains is also used in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span> area and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Classified Dictionary</span> area.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer is distributed with a list of domains already installed. This list is the Dictionary Development Process
		 (DDP) list of domains. You can find out more about using semantic domains by visiting the DDP website (http://www.sil.org/computing/ddp/index.htm).
		 You can edit the list to make it more relevant to your language and culture.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sSenseStatus"></a>5.5.17&nbsp;Sense Status
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense Status</span> list enables you to create a list that describes various status levels of a sense. For instance you can indicate whether
		 an editor has approved the sense for publication. The list corresponds to the sense level <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Status</span> field in the lexicon. The development of a dictionary may span several years or decades. A researcher may work on an entry,
		 doing research, filling in fields, and writing definitions. This field enables each researcher or editor to indicate how much
		 work has been done on the sense, who has checked it, and whether it is ready for publication. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense Status</span> field should not be confused with the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Status</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sSenseTypes"></a>5.5.18&nbsp;Sense Types
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense Types</span> list enables you to create a list of sense types that you can use to label senses in your dictionary. It corresponds to the
		 sense level <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense Type</span> field in the lexicon. The default values are primary and figurative, but you can use it to be more specific. For instance
		 you could use it to indicate the conceptual metaphor that a sense is based on.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sStatus"></a>5.5.19&nbsp;Status
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Status</span> list enables you to create a list that describes various status levels. The list corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Status</span> field that is used in many of the lists in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">List</span> area. It is not used in the lexicon. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Status</span> field should not be confused with the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense Status</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sTextMarkupTags"></a>5.5.20&nbsp;Text Markup Tags
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Text Markup Tags</span> list enables you to create a list of tags to use in marking the syntactic constituents of a sentence in a text. You use this
		 list in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Texts &amp; Words--Interlinear Texts--Tagging</span> tab.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sTranslationTypes"></a>5.5.21&nbsp;Translation Types
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Translation Types</span> list enables you to create a list of translation styles that you would use to label the translations of example sentences
		 in your dictionary. If you give more than one translation of an example sentence, you can label each one to indicate what
		 kind of translation style it uses. This is especially useful if you need to give both a literal translation and a free translation
		 of an example sentence. This list corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Type</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Example</span> bundle of fields in the lexicon.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sUsages"></a>5.5.22&nbsp;Usages
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Usages</span> list enables you to create a list of social situations that you can use to indicate pragmatic restrictions on the usage of
		 a sense in your dictionary. It corresponds to the sense level <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Usages</span> field in the lexicon. If a sense of a lexeme is restricted in its usage, you should try to determine what factor restricts
		 its usage and add that factor to this list. You can also use this list for other aspects of the usage of a sense, such as
		 when a sense is rare or archaic.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sVariantTypes"></a>5.5.23&nbsp;Variant Types
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Types</span> list enables you to create a list of types of variants and irregularly inflected forms. It corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Type</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section of the entry. If you have been using Language Explorer for some time, you will recognize that this list partially
		 replaces the old Entry Type list. (The other Entry Types are handled by the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Form Types</span> list.)
	  </p>
	  <p>You should create an item in this list for each kind of variant. The list is hierarchical. So you can create a list of dialects
		 under a major heading 'Dialectal Variant'. You can do the same for other kinds of variants, such as register variants.
	  </p>
	  <p>This version of Language Explorer lumps irregularly inflected forms together with variants. So you will need to create a list
		 item for each of them. I would recommend that you create a list item for each type of irregularly inflected form under the
		 major heading 'Irregularly Inflected Form' (or perhaps 'Inflectional Variant'). For instance for English you would need a
		 list item for irregular plural forms of nouns (e.g. men), irregular past tense forms of verbs (e.g. broke), and irregular
		 past participles (e.g. broken). If you have a highly inflected language, it might be difficult to create enough list items
		 to sufficiently label each irregular form. Unfortunately there is no other way to label irregularly inflected forms so that
		 the labels can be used by Language Explorer in its system of cross-referencing minor entries.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sRevIndexCat"></a>5.5.24&nbsp;Reversal Index Categories
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Index Categories</span> list is used in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon--Reversals Indexes</span> area to indicate the grammatical category of reversal index words. So it is a list of analysis language grammatical categories.
		 It corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category</span> field. Note that the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversals Indexes</span> area is the grammatical category of the analysis language word, not the vernacular word. The grammatical category of the
		 vernacular word is automatically supplied from the lexicon. The list of vernacular grammatical categories is maintained in
		 the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar-Category Edit</span> area.
	  </p>
	  <h1 style=""><a name="sEntry"></a>6&nbsp;The entry
	  </h1>
	  <p>When linguists and lexicographers analyze lexical information, it is clear that there is structure in how the information
		 is organized. There is structure in the mental lexicon, structure in a computerized dictionary database, and structure in
		 a published dictionary. In order to make Language Explorer a more powerful program and in order to make the publication of
		 a dictionary more straightforward, it was necessary to standardize the structure of the lexical database within Language Explorer.
		 It is also necessary to standardize the structure of published dictionaries to some degree, while permitting as much freedom
		 as possible. Doing so makes your job much easier.
	  </p>
	  <p>Because of this, Language Explorer has established an underlying structure for lexical information within the program. This
		 structure is reflected in what you see in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon-Entry</span> pane. You cannot change the order of the fields in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon-Entry</span> view. However you can change the order of the fields in any of the browse views in order to bring together information that
		 you want to compare. The structure of information in Language Explorer is very complicated and detailed. It is not necessary
		 for you to understand all the details. However, if you are interested, I have described some of the more important aspects
		 of the structure in section <a href="#sStructure">6.1</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer has also established a default structure for a published dictionary. This is what you see in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span> area and in the top right pane in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit-Entry</span> pane. However you can change the ordering of the fields and how they are formatted in these dictionary views by changing
		 the settings in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Dictionary</span> dialog box. You access this in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span> under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools</span> menu.
	  </p>
	  <p>There are good reasons to enforce a logical structure on lexical data in a database. The biggest benefit to you is that you
		 no longer need to worry about what order the fields should be in or what fields are subordinate to others. This enables you
		 to concentrate on the data itself.
	  </p>
	  <p>Other dictionary software (such as Toolbox) does not enforce structure on the data. This permitted a great deal of freedom,
		 but resulted in serious problems whenever you needed to use or manipulate the data in any way. For instance printing a dictionary
		 that is not correctly structured results in serious errors in the printout. (For more on this subject see section <a href="#sStandVsFlex">2.1.4</a>.) To solve these sorts of problems, the team that designed Language Explorer developed a linguistically sound data structure.
		 This enables the program to do linguistically sophisticated tasks. When you enter data into the lexicon, it is automatically
		 structured for you. You can still format the data in various ways for publication, but the data itself is stored using the
		 standardized structured.
	  </p>
	  <p>The data structure in Language Explorer assumes that the data relates to a single language (with allowance for dialectal variants).
		 If you want to create something like a comparative dictionary that has a very different underlying structure, you will have
		 to use a program like Toolbox that permits you to structure the data in any way you want.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sStructure"></a>6.1&nbsp;The structure of the entry
	  </h2>
	  <p>The mental dictionary has a very complicated structure. However for practical reasons a dictionary database must be organized
		 on the same basis as a published dictionary--around the lexeme form. So the critical field in Language Explorer is the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field. The database is in the form of records. Each record consists of a single lexeme and each record is headed by the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <p>A dictionary entry is basically organized as a hierarchy. However it is a little more complicated than that. The article is
		 divided into two primary parts--those fields that relate to the entry as a whole, and those that relate to a single sense.
		 So Language Explorer has a section for entry level fields and another section for sense level fields. But an entry can have
		 more than one sense. Each sense contains a set of fields that form a bundle. So there can be more than one set of these fields
		 in an entry. Some fields only occur once per entry or once per sense, while others can be repeated.
	  </p>
	  <p>There are several fields on the entry level that can occur more than once. If you specify the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry Type</span> as either Derivative, Compound, or Phrase, you can link the entry to more than one root or affix in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Components</span> field. You can specify more than one pronunciation for an entry. Each <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field comes with an associated <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">CV Pattern</span> field, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tone</span> field, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Location</span> field. These four fields form a bundle. You can specify more than one cross-reference in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Cross References</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <p>There are also several fields on the sense level that can occur more than once. You can add more than one example sentence
		 in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Example</span> field. Each <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Example</span> field comes with an associated <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Translation</span> field, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Type</span> field, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reference</span> field. These four fields form a bundle. You can specify more than one usage feature in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Usages</span> field. You can create more than one reversal entry in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Entries</span> field. You can specify more than one academic domain in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Academic Domains</span> field. You can specify more than one semantic domain in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Semantic Domains</span> field. You can specify more than one anthropology category in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Anthropology Categories</span> field. You can specify more than one lexical relation in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <p>The mental lexicon forms links between various linguistic forms. Language Explorer enables you to capture these links in various
		 ways. You can cross-reference lexemes using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Components</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Cross References</span>, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> fields. You can capture groups of related lexemes using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Semantic Domains</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Academic Domains</span>, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Anthropology Categories</span> fields.
	  </p>
	  <p>A single lexeme may have variants. You capture these in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section of the entry. You can add more than one variant. Each <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Form</span> field comes with an associated <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Type</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Show Minor Entry</span>, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Comment</span> field. These four fields form a bundle.
	  </p>
	  <p>A single lexeme may have inflected forms. There is no systematic way to capture all the potential inflected forms of a lexeme.
		 (There may be hundreds or even thousands in highly inflected languages.) However you can capture irregularly inflected forms
		 in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section of the entry.
	  </p>
	  <p>A single lexeme may have more than one allomorph. You capture these in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Allomorphs</span> section of the entry. You can add more than one allomorph in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Affix Allomorph</span> or <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Stem Allomorph</span> field. (The name of the field changes depending on whether the lexeme is an affix or stem.) Each <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Allomorph</span> field comes with an associated <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Is Abstract Form</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Environments</span>, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Stem Name</span> field. These five fields form a bundle.
	  </p>
	  <p>The reason why there is a separate <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info Details</span> section at the bottom of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane is because an entry can have more than one sense and each sense can belong to a different grammatical category. Each
		 grammatical category used in the entry is displayed in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category Info</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info Details</span> section. You indicate the grammatical category of a sense in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span> field within the sense. If you need to further specify the grammatical category by indicating its inflection class, inflection
		 features, and exception "features", you do this in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info Details</span> section. This bundle of four fields is then available to be assigned to other senses. The way this all works is explained
		 more fully in section <a href="#sGramInfoSLFi">6.2.2.4</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h2 style=""><a name="sDescFields"></a>6.2&nbsp;Description of fields
	  </h2>
	  <p>In this section each field is briefly described. The description focuses on the nature of the field, the contents of the field,
		 and the purpose of the field. You can find more information on each field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> files by searching for the field name. You can also right click on a field name in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit-Entry</span> pane and then choose <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> from the menu.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sEntryLevFi"></a>6.2.1&nbsp;Entry level fields
	  </h3>
	  <p>The entry level fields form the first part of the entry in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit--Entry</span> pane. The information in these fields applies to the entire entry.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sLexFormFi"></a>6.2.1.1&nbsp;Lexeme Form
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field is used to record the underlying or basic form of the lexeme. If the lexeme can be inflected, you would enter the uninflected
		 form of the stem in this field. If you wish to use an inflected form of the lexeme as the headword in the published dictionary,
		 you would put that form in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field. If there is nothing in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field, the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field will be used as the headword. If the lexeme has allomorphs, you would enter them in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Alternate Forms</span> section. If the lexeme has variants, you should indicate them in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section. If you wish to record inflected forms of the lexeme, you should create a <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Custom</span> field for each paradigm form (e.g. the plural of a noun or the past tense of a verb). The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field should be reserved for the underlying, basic, uninflected allomorph, root, or stem. Since lexemes can be more than
		 one word, you can enter lexical phrases into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <p>Many languages require the use of an inflected form as the headword of the dictionary entry. When collecting words, native
		 speakers will often supply the word in its citation form rather than as an uninflected stem. For instance the Dictionary Development
		 Process word collection method uses native speakers to collect words. These are typed into the computer using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span> tool. The lexemes automatically go into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field, whether they are uninflected stems or inflected citation forms. If you find that the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field contains many inflected citation forms, you can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools to copy the inflected forms into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field and then delete the affixes from the form in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field. For instructions on how to do this see section <a href="#sGenLexForm">4.2.8</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>The contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field are used by the parser. If it is an abstract form (i.e. not an orthographic form that occurs in texts), you must indicate
		 this in the Is <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Abstract Form</span> field so that it will not be used by the parser.
	  </p>
	  <p>When importing data from an existing dictionary that was created using another program, sometimes an error occurs and nothing
		 is imported into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field. If this happens, you should immediately fill in the field with the correct form. So the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field should always have something in it. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field is critical for many of the functions in Language Explorer.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sIsAbsFormFi"></a>6.2.1.2&nbsp;Is Abstract Form
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Is Abstract Form</span> field is a toggle switch indicating whether the lexeme form is an abstract form or an orthographic form. An example of an
		 abstract form would be '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">iN-</span>', an abstract representation of the English morpheme which has the two orthographic forms <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'in-</span>' and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'im-</span>', as in '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">incomplete</span>' and '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">impossible</span>'. In this example '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">iN-</span>' would be entered in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field, and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'in-</span>' and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'im-</span>' would be entered in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Alternate Forms</span> section. There is an <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Is Abstract Form</span> field following each <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Allomorph</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Alternate Forms</span> section. All of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Is Abstract Form</span> fields work the same way. If there is a check in the box in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Is Abstract Form</span> field, this indicates the form is abstract. If there is no check in the box, this indicates the form is orthographic. The
		 abstract form '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">iN-</span>' would be marked as an abstract form by clicking the box, while <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'in-</span>' and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">'im-</span>' would be marked as orthographic forms by leaving the box unchecked.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sMorphTypeFi"></a>6.2.1.3&nbsp;Morph Type (Morpheme Type)
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field is used to indicate the type of morpheme contained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field. Morphemes fall into two basic types--affixes and roots. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field is used by the parser. Information from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field will also be gleaned for use in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar Sketch</span>.
	  </p>
	  <p>When you create a new entry in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit</span>, the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">New Entry</span> dialog box is displayed. You can indicate the morpheme type in the second line:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xNewEntry">(88)</a></td>
			   <td>
				  <table>
					 <tr>
						<td valign="top"><img src="NewEntry.jpg"></td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>When you type the lexeme form into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> box, the program looks to see if the form is an affix or a stem. If you typed a hyphen at the beginning of the form (as in
		 the example above), the program assumes it is a suffix and automatically picks 'suffix' from the list in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morpheme Type</span> box. If you type a hyphen at the end, it assumes it is a prefix. If you type a hyphen at the beginning and the end, it assumes
		 it is an infix. If you type an equal sign, it assumes it is a proclitic or enclitic. If you type no hyphen or equal sign in
		 the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> box, the program automatically assigns the entry to the morpheme type 'stem'. However you can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morpheme Type</span> box to manually change the morpheme type to one of the following options:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xMToptions">(89)</a></td>
			   <td>
				  <table>
					 <tr>
						<td><img src="MToptions.jpg"></td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>Notice that the options include the punctuation that you use in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> box to indicate the morpheme type. (These are called leading and trailing tokens.) If you use the correct punctuation (token),
		 Language Explorer will automatically assign the lexeme to the correct morpheme type, saving you the step of indicating it
		 in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morpheme Type</span> box.
	  </p>
	  <p>Once you have created an entry, you can change the morpheme type using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit--Entry</span> pane. If you chose one of the affix options when you created the entry, you will only see the following options in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Choose Morpheme Type</span> dialog box:
	  </p>
	  <p>circumfix, infix, interfixing interfix, prefix, prefixing interfix, simulfix, suffix, suffixing interfix, suprafix</p>
	  <p>If you chose one of the stem options when you created the entry, you will only see the following options:</p>
	  <p>bound root, bound stem, discontiguous phrase, enclitic, particle, phrase, proclitic, root, stem</p>
	  <p>However you can select the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Show all Types</span> option at the bottom of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Choose Morpheme Type</span> dialog box and all the options will be displayed.
	  </p>
	  <p>If the lexeme is a derivative or compound rather than a single morpheme, you should select 'stem' from the list of options.
		 If the lexeme is a lexical phrase, you should select 'phrase' from the list of options. For instructions on using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools to fill in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field see section <a href="#sSpecMorphT">4.2.2</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can see a list of all the morpheme types in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morpheme Type</span> list in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area. You cannot add or delete items from the list, but you can edit the fields. For instance you can change the leading
		 and trailing tokens.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sEnvironFi"></a>6.2.1.4&nbsp;Environments
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Environments</span> field is used to indicate the phonological environment of an allomorph. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Environments</span> field is used by the parser. Instead of typing out an environment, you pick the environment from a list of possible environments.
		 The list is maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar--Environments</span> area. You can create as many environments as you need. Once you have created an environment, you can use it to condition
		 any number of allomorphs. If you create an environment for an allomorph of one morpheme and then find that an allomorph of
		 another morpheme uses the same environment, you can reuse the environment you created for the first allomorph. You can pick
		 more than one environment from the list.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sStemNameFi"></a>6.2.1.5&nbsp;Stem Name
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Stem Name</span> field is used to label an allomorph that is conditioned by a grammatical context rather than a phonological context. The
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Stem Name</span> field is used by the parser. You create a stem name in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar--Category Edit</span> area. For more on the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Stem Name</span> field see Andy Black's paper 'Introduction to Parsing' under <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Resources</span> in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help</span> files menu.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sCitFormFi"></a>6.2.1.6&nbsp;Citation Form
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field is used to record the form of the lexeme that you want to appear as the headword in a published dictionary. You would
		 use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field when the stem form of the lexeme (which you would put in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field) is not a naturally occurring word and you do not want to use it as the headword. If the uninflected stem is not a
		 good choice for the headword and you would prefer an inflected form, put the uninflected stem in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field and the inflected form in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field. Language Explorer uses the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field as the headword in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span> view. If there is nothing in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field, it will use the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field as the headword. The parser uses the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field, but ignores the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field. For more on the difference between the lexeme form and citation form see section <a href="#sLexVSCF">3.3.3</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>If your language requires the use of an inflected form as the headword, you will very likely find that you are collecting
		 words in the citation form rather than the uninflected stem. If you enter these inflected forms into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field, you will have to copy them into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field and then correct the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field by deleting the affixes. For instructions on how to do this see section <a href="#sGenLexForm">4.2.8</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sHeadwordFi"></a>6.2.1.7&nbsp;Headword
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field is used to display the form of the lexeme that will be used as the headword in the publication views. It cannot be
		 displayed in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit--Entry</span> pane. However it can be displayed in the various browse views. Language Explorer uses the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field as the headword in each of the publication views (<span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Dictionary</span> view, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Classified Dictionary</span> view, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Indexes</span> view). It is also used in various search functions, such as the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Main Entries or Senses</span> dialog box. Cross-references use the headword to refer to another entry.
	  </p>
	  <p>You cannot edit the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field because the contents of the field are taken from either the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field or the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field. Language Explorer automatically copies the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Headword</span> field. If there is nothing in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Citation Form</span> field, it copies the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field. So the citation form takes priority over the lexeme form. If you want to change the headword, you must edit the citation
		 form or the lexeme form. For more on the difference between the lexeme form, citation form, and headword see section <a href="#sLeVSCiVSHe">3.3.4</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sCompFrmsFi"></a>6.2.1.8&nbsp;Complex Forms
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Forms</span> field is used in an entry for a root to list all the complex forms that you have linked to the root. It is a virtual field,
		 meaning that you do not enter data into it. Instead Language Explorer automatically puts something into the field whenever
		 you link a complex form to the root. The field is merely for your convenience and information. You can right-click on one
		 of the entries listed and jump to the entry or to a concordance of the entry. Language Explorer uses the list to format your
		 published dictionary. Depending on the choices you make in <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools-Configure Dictionary</span>, it will create a subentry or cross-reference for each lexeme listed here.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sCompFrmTypeFi"></a>6.2.1.9&nbsp;Complex Form Type
	  </h4>
	  <p>If a lexeme is a complex form (a derivative, compound, or lexical phrase), you use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Form Type</span> field to specify what kind of complex form it is. A complex forms is any lexeme that is composed of more than one morpheme.
		 For instructions on using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools to generate the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Form Type</span> field see section <a href="#sSpecCompFrmT">4.2.3</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>You maintain the list of complex form types in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists--Complex Form Types</span> area. You can create new complex form types in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Form Type</span> pane.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sComponentsFi"></a>6.2.1.10&nbsp;Components
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Components</span> field is used to link a complex form to its root (or roots). You can also link a derivative to its derivational affixes.
		 Currently you cannot link a complex form to another complex form. For instance you could not link <span style="color:#0000ff; ">incurable</span> to <span style="color:#0000ff; ">curable</span>. You would have to link it to its root <span style="color:#0000ff; ">cure</span>. In other words you can only link a complex form to its constituent morphemes. If you link a complex form to another complex
		 form, Language Explorer will not display the entry anywhere in your dictionary.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sShowSubFi"></a>6.2.1.11&nbsp;Show Subentry under
	  </h4>
	  <p>In a root-based dictionary each complex form is presented as a subentry under one of its roots. If a complex form has more
		 than one root, you use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Show Subentry under</span> field to specify which root you want the subentry to appear under. You must first link the complex form to its roots in the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Components</span> field. You can choose more than one root, but this will have the effect of duplicating the subentry under each root.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sShowMinCFFi"></a>6.2.1.12&nbsp;Show Minor Entry (for Complex Form)
	  </h4>
	  <p>In a root-based dictionary each complex form is presented as a subentry under one of its roots. If it would be difficult for
		 the user to find the entry, you can create a minor entry for the complex form. The minor entry will alphabetize where the
		 complex form would have appeared in a stem-based dictionary, making it possible for the user to look up the spelling of the
		 complex form. For instance the root of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">prospective</span> is <span style="color:#0000ff; ">spec</span>, the root of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">prosthesis</span> is <span style="color:#0000ff; ">thesis</span> (or <span style="color:#0000ff; ">the</span>), and the root of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">prototype</span> is <span style="color:#0000ff; ">type</span>. Because of the difficulty in knowing how to analyze these forms, it would be necessary to create a minor entry for each
		 to direct the user to the correct root entry.<span style="font-size:65%; vertical-align:super">[<a href="#nEngRootDict">11</a>]</span> The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Show Minor Entry</span> field is used to indicate whether or not you want Language Explorer to generate a minor entry for the complex form.

	  <h4 style=""><a name="sCommCompFi"></a>6.2.1.13&nbsp;Comment (on Complex Form Type)
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Comment</span> field is used to record a note to yourself about your handling of a complex form. This field should not be confused with
		 other <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Comment</span> fields, such as the one in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section and the one in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Etymology</span> section. All three are note fields for the relevant section.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sVarTypeFi"></a>6.2.1.14&nbsp;Variant Type
	  </h4>
	  <p>If the current entry is a variant of another entry, you would use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Type</span> field to indicate what type of variant the current entry is. This field only shows when you have indicated that the current
		 entry is either a variant of a basic form or an irregularly inflected form of a lexeme. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Type</span> field is a list field. The list is maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists-Variant Types</span> area. This field corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Type</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section toward the bottom of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane. For instructions on handling variants see section <a href="#sVariants">3.2.2</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sVarOfFi"></a>6.2.1.15&nbsp;Variant of
	  </h4>
	  <p>If the current entry is a variant of another entry, you would use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant of</span> field to link the current entry to the entry for the basic form. If you created the current entry using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant</span> section of the basic form entry, then this field will already be filled in.
	  </p>
	  <p>This field is the reverse of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Form</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section of the basic form entry. The two fields form the opposite ends of the link between the two entries. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant of</span> field contains the basic form and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Form</span> contains the variant. For instructions on handling variants see section <a href="#sVariants">3.2.2</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sShowMinVFi"></a>6.2.1.16&nbsp;Show Minor Entry (for Variant)
	  </h4>
	  <p>Use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Show Minor Entry</span> field to indicate whether or not you want Language Explorer to create a minor entry for this variant. This field corresponds
		 to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Show Minor Entry</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section toward the bottom of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane.

	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sCommVarFi"></a>6.2.1.17&nbsp;Comment (on Variant)
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Comment</span> field is used to make a note to yourself about the variant in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Form</span> field. This field should not be confused with other <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Comment</span> fields, such as the one in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Form</span> section and the one in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Etymology</span> section. All three are note fields for the relevant section.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sPronuncFi"></a>6.2.1.18&nbsp;Pronunciation
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field is used to record the pronunciation of the headword, usually by transcribing it phonetically in the International Phonetic
		 Alphabet (IPA). Since the IPA is often not understood or useable by non-linguists, sometimes the pronunciation is indicated
		 in a modified orthographic script. In a monolingual dictionary designed for native speakers this is often a good choice. Native
		 speakers may not need a detailed phonetic transcription, but may benefit from an indication of features of the phonology that
		 are not captured by the standard orthography. For instance many monolingual English dictionaries indicate stress. If your
		 language has lexical tone or stress, which is not marked in the orthography, you can use the Pronunciation field to indicate
		 it. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field can also be used to indicate syllable breaks for use in hyphenating words at the end of a line of text. If, on the
		 other hand, you are producing a bilingual dictionary that will be used for learning the vernacular language, you should probably
		 use IPA in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field, since IPA is becoming a standard in the international language learning community.
	  </p>
	  <p>In order to save space some lexicographers eliminate the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field and instead use the headword to mark stress, tone, or other features. Other lexicographers prefer to use the headword
		 to indicate the orthographic representation of the word. If your language is newly literate and you want the dictionary to
		 be used to promote literacy and teach people how to write the language, then it would be best to use the headword to give
		 the spelling of the lexeme using the proposed orthography. In this case you would need to use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field to indicate any features of the pronunciation that are not captured by the orthography.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field is also used to record dialectal pronunciation variants. If you have a standardized orthography that is used by several
		 dialects, you would record dialectal variants here. Only when a variant is spelled differently would you need to create a
		 separate entry for it in Language Explorer. If the variants are spelled the same, you would have to use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field for them. For instructions on using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools to generate the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field see section <a href="#sAddPronunc">4.2.9</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sCVPatternFi"></a>6.2.1.19&nbsp;CV Pattern
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">CV Pattern</span> field is used to record the consonant-vowel pattern of the form in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field. There is a <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">CV Pattern</span> field for each <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field, since the CV pattern may be different for each pronunciation. You create the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">CV Pattern</span> field by copying the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">CV Pattern</span> field and replacing each consonant with a 'C' and each vowel with a 'V'. You can further refine the pattern by using other
		 symbols such as 'S' for semivowel or 'N' for nasal, if these affect the syllable structure or phonology in significant ways.
		 In fact you can be creative in the use of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">CV Pattern</span> field to meet your needs. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">CV Pattern</span> field is very useful for various tasks in phonological analysis. For instance tone patterns are often affected by the CV
		 pattern of the word. So it is helpful to be able to sort words by their CV pattern. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">CV Pattern</span> field is not used by the parser and would not normally be included in a published dictionary. It is including in Language
		 Explorer as an analysis tool. For instructions on using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools to generate the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">CV Pattern</span> field see section <a href="#sAddCV">4.2.10</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sToneFi"></a>6.2.1.20&nbsp;Tone
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tone</span> field is used to record the tone or stress pattern of the form in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field. There is a <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tone</span> field for each <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field, since the tone pattern may be different for each pronunciation. You create the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tone</span> field by copying the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tone</span> field and replacing each consonant with a period (or simply nothing) and each vowel with an 'H' for high tone and an 'L'
		 for low tone'. You can use other symbols such as 'F' for falling tone or 'R' for rising tone. You can also use numbers or
		 any other symbols you want. This assumes that tone is already marked in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field. If you have not marked tone, you can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tone</span> field to enter it. However it is wiser to mark it in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field and then use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools to generate the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tone</span> field. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tone</span> field is not used by the parser and would not normally be included in a published dictionary, although it could be. It is
		 including in Language Explorer as an analysis tool. For instructions on using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit</span> tools to generate the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tone</span> field see section <a href="#sAddTone">4.2.11</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tone</span> field is not used by the parser and would not normally be included in a published dictionary, although it could be. It is
		 including in Language Explorer as an analysis tool. Some languages have tone processes that modify the underlying tone of
		 a stem when it is affixed or when it occurs in isolation (when it is pronounced by itself). In such cases you might want to
		 indicate the underlying tone of the stem in one field and the surface tone of the citation form in another field. Since the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tone</span> field is subordinated to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field, it would be best to use it to indicate surface tone and set up a custom field on the entry level for the underlying
		 tone.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sLocationFi"></a>6.2.1.21&nbsp;Location
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Location</span> field is used to indicate the location where a pronunciation variant is used. For instance if you have a standardized orthography
		 that is used by several dialects, you would indicate dialectal pronunciation variants in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Pronunciation</span> field. You would indicate the dialect in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Location</span> field. The location is chosen from a list. The list is maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists--Locations</span> area. You can create as many locations as you need. These locations can be the names of dialects, districts, towns, or whatever
		 other designation you wish. The contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Location</span> field do not have to be a physical location. For instance if a particular pronunciation is a register variant, you can use
		 the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Location</span> field to indicate the register.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sEtymologyFi"></a>6.2.1.22&nbsp;Etymology
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Etymology</span> field is used to indicate the proto-language form of the word. For instance the English word 'name' is descended from the
		 proto-Indo-European root '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">nomen</span>'.
	  </p>
	  <p>Note that there is currently no field in Language Explorer specifically devoted to borrowed words. An expansion of the etymology
		 section has been requested. Until the programmers can implement it, you can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Etymology</span> field to indicate borrowed words. However it would be wiser to set up a custom field for them in order to keep inherited
		 words and borrowed words separate in the database. In order to fully specify a borrowed word, you could set up separate custom
		 fields to indicate the source language, the form in the source language, and the original meaning in the source language.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sGlossEtyFi"></a>6.2.1.23&nbsp;Gloss (of Etymology)
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field is used to indicate the meaning of the proto-language form given in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Etymology</span> field. (Note that this <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field is different than the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field on the sense level.) For instance the English word '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">hell</span>' is from the proto-Indo-European root '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">kel</span>'. But '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">kel</span>' originally meant '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">to cover, conceal</span>' <a href="#rAHD">Morris (1978)</a>. So you would enter 'to cover, conceal' in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sCommentEtyFi"></a>6.2.1.24&nbsp;Comment (on Etymology)
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Comment</span> field is used to record any comments you might want to make about the etymology of the lexeme. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Comment</span> field is adapted from the MDF "Etymology Comment" field, which in that system was a note field and not intended for printing.
		 It is included in Language Explorer so that you will have a place for notes to yourself to remind yourself of issues and factors
		 related to your analysis. For instance in section <a href="#sGlossEtyFi">6.2.1.23</a> I mentioned that the English word '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">hell</span>' is from the proto form '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">kel</span>'. The evidence for this is that the Germanic form from which '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">hell</span>' is descended was '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">halj&#333;</span>', which meant '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">concealed place</span>'. You could put this evidence in the Comment field.
	  </p>
	  <p>If you are uncertain of the etymology of a word, you can discuss the options in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Comment</span> field. For instance '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">name</span>' is descended from '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">nomen</span>'. The word '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">nominate</span>' looks very similar to both '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">name</span>' and the Latin word '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">n&#333;men</span>', which also meant '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">name</span>'. If you didn't have good historical evidence, you might be uncertain if '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">nominate</span>' was descended from the proto-Indo-European '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">nomen</span>' or borrowed from the Latin '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">n&#333;men</span>'. (In fact it is borrowed from the Latin.) You could note the two possibilities and the pros and cons of each in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Comment</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <p>This field should not be confused with other <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Comment</span> fields, such as the one in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Form</span> section and the one in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant</span> section. All three are note fields for the relevant section.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sSourceEtyFi"></a>6.2.1.25&nbsp;Source (of Etymology)
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Source</span> field is used to indicate the source of the information in the Etymology field. For instance the information about the etymology
		 of the English word '<span style="color:#0000ff; ">hell</span>' in section <a href="#sGlossEtyFi">6.2.1.23</a> was taken from the American Heritage Dictionary on page 1521. So I would put something like "AHD:1521" in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Source</span> field. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Source</span> field is adapted from the MDF "Etymology Source" field, which in that system was a note field and not intended for printing.
		 If you use a published work to find information about the etymology of words, you should indicate this in your introduction
		 and include a reference to it in your bibliography. If you do this, it would not be necessary to print the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Source</span> field in your dictionary. This field should not be confused with the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Source</span> field on the sense level.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sNoteFi"></a>6.2.1.26&nbsp;Note
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Note</span> field is used to make a note to yourself about any aspect of the entry. Since it is an entry level field, you should use
		 it to make notes about the entry level fields. There are several note fields on the sense level to handle sense level issues.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sLitMeaningFi"></a>6.2.1.27&nbsp;Literal Meaning
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Literal Meaning</span> field is used to indicate the literal meaning of a complex form. For instance the Koine Greek idiom '<span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">klei&#333; ta splankhna</span>' (<span style="font-family:Galatia SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">&#954;&#955;&#949;&#8055;&#969; &#964;&#8048; &#963;&#960;&#955;&#8049;&#947;&#967;&#957;&#945;</span>) means <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'refuse to show compassion'</span>, but literally means <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'close the intestines'</span>. Sometimes the literal meaning of a complex form can give a clue as to its meaning. For instance I have found it helpful
		 to use the literal meaning of complex forms to identify conceptual metaphors. On the other hand, the original motivation for
		 coining a word or phrase may be lost in history. In such cases the literal meaning may actually be misleading. For instance
		 the literal meaning of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">understand</span> seems to have nothing to do with standing under something. Some lexicographers believe that including the literal meaning
		 in a bilingual dictionary will help a language learner "think" in the language. For instance the literal meaning of the English
		 idiom <span style="color:#0000ff; ">hot under the collar</span> <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'to be angry'</span> is based on the conceptual metaphor "Anger is heat and pressure" and refers to the tendency for a person's neck to turn red
		 when he is angry. Understanding how the literal meaning and actual meaning are related can be helpful. On the other hand,
		 studies have shown that a lot of vocabulary acquisition happens subconsciously. In either case, including the literal meaning
		 of complex forms can be interesting.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sBiblioELFi"></a>6.2.1.28&nbsp;Bibliography
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bibliography</span> field is used for a bibliographical reference to a book or article that discusses the lexeme. For instance a grammatical
		 word might be discussed in a published grammar, or a culturally important word might be discussed in an anthropology paper.
		 The contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bibliography</span> field can either be a short reference to an entry in the bibliography section of the published dictionary or a full reference
		 if there is no bibliography in the published dictionary. This field is intended to be printed. There is also a <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bibliography</span> field on the sense level (see section <a href="#sBiblioSLFi">6.2.2.8</a>).
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sRestrictELFi"></a>6.2.1.29&nbsp;Restrictions
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Restrictions</span> field is an entry level field used to indicate grammatical, semantic, or pragmatic restrictions on all senses of the lexeme.
		 This would enable you to avoid having to repeat the information for each sense.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sSumDefFi"></a>6.2.1.30&nbsp;Summary Definition
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Summary Definition</span> field is used for a single definition that summarizes all the senses of a lexeme. The field is used when you want to gloss
		 a cross-reference in your published dictionary. You can configure Language Explorer to display the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Summary Definition</span> field in a published dictionary by going to <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools-Configure Dictionary</span>. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Summary Definition</span> field is available on the entry level under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Forms</span> section, the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Cross References</span> section, and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Component Reference</span> section. It is available on the sense level under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants of Sense</span> section. Following the sense level fields, it is available under the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Forms</span> section. In order to use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Summary Definition</span> field for all cross-references, you would have to enable it in each of these places.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sIncAsHeadFi"></a>6.2.1.31&nbsp;Exclude As Headword
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Exclude As Headword</span> field is used to exclude an entry from the published dictionary. It does not just exclude the headword (as the name would
		 suggest), but excludes the entire entry. Sometimes you may need to create an entry in your lexicon in order to interlinearize
		 a word (such as a foreign word or name) in a text. You may also want to create entries for all your affixes, but not want
		 them in the dictionary. In order to prevent such an entry from being displayed in your published dictionary, you should put
		 a check mark in the box in this field. You can use <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries-List Choice</span> to exclude many entries at once.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sCrossRefFi"></a>6.2.1.32&nbsp;Cross References
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Cross References</span> field is used to create a cross-reference between two entries rather than two senses. To create a cross-reference between
		 two senses you should use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field on the sense level. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Cross References</span> field and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field both use the same set of lexical relations. The list of lexical relations is maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists-Lexical Relations</span> area. Note that lexical relations are semantic relations and therefore properly belong on the sense level. In fact I don't
		 know when you would ever use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Cross References</span> field. A relationship on the entry level would be between two forms. In Language Explorer relations between forms are handled
		 by the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Complex Forms</span> section and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section.

	  <p>When you import data into Language Explorer, any data that does not map into one of the Language Explorer fields will be placed
		 in one of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Import Residue</span> fields. If the data relates to the entire entry, it will be put into the entry level <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Import Residue</span> field. If it relates to a particular sense, it will be put in the sense level <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Import Residue</span> field for that sense. You can use <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Copy</span> or <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Click Copy</span> to move data from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Import Residue</span> field to any field you choose.

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sSenseLevFi"></a>6.2.2&nbsp;Sense level fields
	  </h3>
	  <p>The sense level fields form a bundle that can be repeated for each sense. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Entry</span> pane always displays one sense in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense 1</span> section. You insert a second sense by clicking somewhere in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense 1</span> line and then clicking <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Insert Sense</span>. You can also insert a subsense by clicking just to the left of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense 1</span> field label. This accesses a menu. Click <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Insert Subsense</span>.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sSenseNumFi"></a>6.2.2.1&nbsp;Sense Number
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense Number</span> field is automatically filled in by Language Explorer. You can add senses, order senses, and create subsenses. Language Explorer
		 automatically adjusts the sense numbers whenever you do one of these things. You can pick different numbering options by going
		 to <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Tools-Configure Dictionary</span> and then clicking on <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Senses</span>. For more on managing senses see section <a href="#sPolysemy">3.7</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sGlossFi"></a>6.2.2.2&nbsp;Gloss
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field is used to store a gloss in an analysis language. A gloss is a very short definition, usually consisting of a single
		 word. A single word gloss in the vernacular would be a synonym. A single word gloss in another language would be a translation
		 equivalent. Often it is not possible to capture the meaning of a lexeme with either a synonym or translation equivalent. If
		 you need more than one word to capture the meaning, you can use a phrase. It is best to keep it as short as possible. If you
		 want to give a long description that better captures the meaning, you should do so in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field. The best way to think about a gloss is to view it as a short indication of the meaning, rather than an accurate explanation.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field is used in three different ways in Language Explorer.
	  </p>
	  <ol style="list-style-type:decimal; ">
		 <li>The gloss is used by the interlinearizer to label each morpheme in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lex. Gloss</span> line. If you use long glosses, the lines in your interlinear display will be very long. So this is a good reason to keep
			them short.
		 </li>
		 <li>If you do not give a definition in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field, the program will use the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field as the definition in your dictionary.
		 </li>
		 <li>If you are working in one of the browse views and need to see some indication of the meaning of the lexeme, you can display
			the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field in one of the columns. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field is better than the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field for this purpose because it is shorter and takes up less of your screen space.
		 </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>If you have set up more than one analysis language, you can enter a gloss for each language. Currently Language Explorer only
		 permits a single gloss per analysis language. This creates problems when a single sense in the vernacular can be translated
		 by several different words in an analysis language. When interlinearizing, some linguists prefer to give a gloss that fits
		 the context. If you wish to do this, you can either give a more contextually relevant gloss in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Word Gloss</span> line or give one in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Free</span> (translation) line. The only other option is to give more than one gloss in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field and separate each one with some character such as a slash. For instance if you have a vernacular word that means <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'sibling'</span> you might want to give <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'brother/sister'</span> as the gloss.
	  </p>
	  <p>If you give a gloss that consists of two or more words, the convention is to use a period or underline character (e.g. 'older.brother'
		 or 'older_brother' to join the words into a single string of characters. The reason for this is that some programs line up
		 an interlinear display on the basis of the spaces in the data. So using spaces in a gloss would mess up the alignment. This
		 is not a problem in Language Explorer. It will correctly handle a gloss with spaces. However for clarity sake you might want
		 to go by the convention. You can easily use <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Edit Entries--Replace</span> to replace all spaces in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field with a period or underline.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sDefinitionFi"></a>6.2.2.3&nbsp;Definition
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field is used to describe the meaning of the word. If you do not give a definition, the program will use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field as the definition. You can give a definition in the vernacular or in any of the other analysis languages. The principles
		 and techniques for writing good definitions are too many and involved to describe them adequately here. I've included a few
		 basic principles in section <a href="#sStage3">4.3</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sGramInfoSLFi"></a>6.2.2.4&nbsp;Grammatical Information
	  </h4>
	  <p>Language Explorer handles 'part of speech' a little differently than you may be used to. The way a word functions in the grammar
		 is more complicated than the traditional part of speech labels like 'noun' or 'verb' can capture. So the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit--Entry</span> pane has a <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info Details</span> section at the bottom that includes the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category Info</span> field (which roughly corresponds to the traditional part of speech), <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Class</span> field, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Features</span> field, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Exception "Features"</span> field. For this reason the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense</span> section is related to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span> section at the bottom of the entry. Each time you indicate a category in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span> field it is listed in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span> section. If you assign different senses to different categories, each is listed in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span> section. You need to indicate the grammatical category for each sense. If more than one sense uses the same grammatical function,
		 you can choose from the list of grammatical functions that you have already set up for the entry. The grammatical functions
		 that you set up are recorded in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Functions</span> area at the end of the record in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexicon Edit-Entry</span> pane. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Function</span> field under each sense is where you choose the grammatical function for that sense.
	  </p>
	  <p>The senses of an entry often belong to the same grammatical category. Rather than have you reproduce all the information in
		 the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span> section for each sense, Language Explorer enables you to give the grammatical information once and then assign it to each
		 sense. You assign a grammatical category to a sense in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense</span> section. You indicate the inflection class, inflection features, and exception "features" in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info Details</span> section. This bundle then is available to assign to more than one sense. If different senses belong to different grammatical
		 categories, you first indicate the grammatical category in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense</span> section. Each grammatical category that you have used in the entry is listed in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info Details</span> section. When you insert secondary senses, you can pick one of the category bundles that are listed in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info Details</span> section. The master list of grammatical categories is maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar</span> area.

	  <h4 style=""><a name="sExampleFi"></a>6.2.2.5&nbsp;Example
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Example</span> field is used to store an example sentence that illustrates the meaning and usage of the sense. When you are working on a
		 sense and want to add an example sentence, you can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Find example sentence</span> tool to get a concordance of the word from your text corpus and copy a sentence into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Example</span> field. You can access this tool by right clicking on the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Example</span> field label, then choosing <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Find example sentence</span> from the menu.

	  <h4 style=""><a name="sSciNameFi"></a>6.2.2.6&nbsp;Scientific Name
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Scientific Name</span> field is used to store the scientific names of plants, animals, chemicals, and other things for which modern science has
		 a technical name. If you use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Scientific Name</span> field, it would generally be printed after the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field, as in the following entry (adapted from the American Heritage Dictionary):
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xWolf1">(90)</a></td>
			   <td>

						   </div>
						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>However many dictionaries incorporate the scientific name into the definition. The definition in the original American Heritage
		 Dictionary entry was as follows:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xWolf2">(91)</a></td>

						   </div>
						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>This entry illustrates two problems with scientific names. First, the non-scientific word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">wolf</span> actually covers more than one species. Second, scientists don't always agree on how to divide kinds of animals into species
		 and subspecies, nor do they always agree on the correct name. The following entry illustrates a similar problem:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xFox">(92)</a></td>

		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>The word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">fox</span> corresponds not just to a genus (a level above the species), but to related genera as well. It is difficult to capture this
		 type of information in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Scientific Name</span> field. You will have to decide on a strategy for handling scientific names. For straightforward cases you may be able to
		 put the scientific name in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Scientific Name</span> field. For more complex cases you will most likely have to discuss the situation within the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field. One advantage of using the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Scientific Name</span> field is that Language Explorer will automatically format it for you, for instance by putting it in italics as is in the
		 examples above.
	  </p>
	  <p>Identifying the scientific name of a plant or animal is not easy for non-experts. You will need to consult books and other
		 resource materials that have photos of the plants and animals in your language area and that give reliable information on
		 the appropriate scientific name. It would be best to obtain the help of a qualified biologist.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sAnthroNoteFi"></a>6.2.2.7&nbsp;Anthropology Note
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Anthropology Note</span> field is used to make notes to yourself about how the current sense relates to cultural issues. For instance you might use
		 it to make a series of observations such as, "The color 'black' appears to be associated with bad things like evil 'black
		 heart', bad feelings 'black mood', and death 'dressed in black'." You might also use it to make a note for further research
		 such as, "Why is 'red' associated with anger?" Like the other note fields, it is not intended to be included in your published
		 dictionary. However you can configure your dictionary to include it.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sBiblioSLFi"></a>6.2.2.8&nbsp;Bibliography
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bibliography</span> field is used for a bibliographical reference to a book or article that discusses the current sense. For instance a grammatical
		 word might be discussed in a published grammar, or a culturally important word might be discussed in an anthropology paper.
		 The contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bibliography</span> field can either be a short reference to an entry in the bibliography section of the published dictionary or a full reference
		 if there is no bibliography in the published dictionary. This field is intended to be printed. There is also a <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bibliography</span> field on the entry level (see section <a href="#sBiblioELFi">6.2.1.28</a>). If you merely want to indicate the person or place where you got your information, you can use the Source field (see section
		 <a href="#sSourceFi">6.2.2.17</a>). If the source is a previously published dictionary, you should get permission to incorporate it into your dictionary. If
		 you have permission, there is no need to give a bibliographical reference for each entry. Instead you should give credit in
		 the introduction to your dictionary and include the prior dictionary in the bibliography.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sDiscNoteFi"></a>6.2.2.9&nbsp;Discourse Note
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Discourse Note</span> field is used to make notes to yourself about how the current sense functions on a discourse level. You can use it to make
		 a note for further research such as, "Does 'once upon a time' mean that the story is fictional?" Like the other note fields,
		 it is not intended to be included in your published dictionary. However you can configure your dictionary to include it.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sEncycloFi"></a>6.2.2.10&nbsp;Encyclopedic Info
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Encyclopedic Info</span> field is used to store information about the sense, which might be considered more appropriate for an encyclopedia than a
		 dictionary. Some lexicographers prefer to write a definition that is succinct and place other information in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Encyclopedic Info</span> field. Other lexicographers do not believe that there is any theoretical basis for dividing knowledge about a lexeme into
		 "definitional knowledge" and "encyclopedic knowledge." Consider the following entry:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>

						   </div>
						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>You might put "A musical instrument in the woodwind family, whose sound is produced by the vibration of a single reed," in
		 the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Definition</span> field and put the rest of the description in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Encyclopedic Info</span> field. However most people's conception of a clarinet would probably include the fact that it is black, has metal keys, and
		 has a straight cylindrical shape with a bell shaped end. In contrast some people might not know that it has a single reed.
		 I played the clarinet for 11 years in school but never knew what plant the reed was made of until I looked it up today on
		 the internet.<span style="font-size:65%; vertical-align:super">[<a href="#nClarinet">12</a>]</span> So what information speakers have in their "mental definition" and what information is encyclopedic is subject to debate.
		 Whatever your theoretical persuasion, you can use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Encyclopedic Info</span> field for extra facts about the lexeme that you don't want to incorporate into your definition.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sGenNoteFi"></a>6.2.2.11&nbsp;General Note
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">General Note</span> field is used to make general notes to yourself about the current sense. For instance you might use it to make an observation
		 such as "This sense is more frequent than sense 1, but is obviously a metaphorical extension." Like the other note fields,
		 it is not intended to be included in your published dictionary. However you can configure your dictionary to include it.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sGramNoteFi"></a>6.2.2.12&nbsp;Grammar Note
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar Note</span> field is used to make notes to yourself about how the current sense works in the grammar. For instance you might use it to
		 record the fact that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">pants</span> is always plural except in compounds such as <span style="color:#0000ff; ">pant leg</span>. You could also use it to make a note for further research such as, "Why is this verb almost always passive?" Like the other
		 note fields, it is not intended to be included in your published dictionary. However you can configure your dictionary to
		 include it.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sPhonNoteFi"></a>6.2.2.13&nbsp;Phonology Note
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Phonology Note</span> field is used to make notes to yourself about the phonological behavior of the current sense. It is very rare for a lexeme
		 to be pronounced differently depending on the sense. So perhaps this field should have been an entry level field. But you
		 can still use it to make notes about the phonology. Like the other note fields, it is not intended to be included in your
		 published dictionary. However you can configure your dictionary to include it.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sRestrictSLFi"></a>6.2.2.14&nbsp;Restrictions
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Restrictions</span> field is where you would record semantic or grammatical restrictions on the usage of this sense of the lexeme. This is similar
		 to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Usages</span> field, except the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Usages</span> field is for sociolinguistic restrictions on usage. Some lexicographers prefer to incorporate this information into the definition
		 and there are techniques for doing so. However if you have systematic restrictions on usage, it might be preferable to handle
		 them here so that you can filter the database for them. This would help you handle them consistently.
	  </p>
	  <p>This field corresponds to the \oe (Only) field in MDF. Unfortunately the MDF manual gives no clear examples of how this field
		 should be used. However you could use it for grammatical restrictions such as "only in progressive aspect" (a restriction
		 on some English verbs) or semantic restrictions such as "always with human subject and object" (also a restriction on some
		 verbs). In the following example (adapted from Longman's Language Activator <a href="#rLongman">Summers (1993)</a>) the phrase "usually before noun" is a grammatical restriction:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">

	  <p>This field should not be confused with the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Restrictions</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area. The two are not related.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sSemNoteFi"></a>6.2.2.15&nbsp;Semantics Note
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Semantics Note</span> field is used to make notes to yourself about the meaning of the current sense. For instance if you have written a definition,
		 but are not sure if it is accurate, you can make a note to yourself to check some aspect of it later. You can also use this
		 field to make a series of lengthy notes about the meaning of a sense, then later compile them into a neat definition. Like
		 the other note fields, it is not intended to be included in your published dictionary. However you can configure your dictionary
		 to include it.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sSocioNoteFi"></a>6.2.2.16&nbsp;Sociolinguistics Note
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sociolinguistics Note</span> field is used to make notes to yourself about the usage of the current sense. For instance you may be unsure if a sense is
		 limited to a particular dialect or register. You could put a note to this effect in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sociolinguistics Note</span> field to remind you to investigate it further at a later date. Like the other note fields, it is not intended to be included
		 in your published dictionary. However you can configure your dictionary to include it.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sSourceFi"></a>6.2.2.17&nbsp;Source
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Source</span> field is used to indicate the source of the information in the current sense. It is often useful to know where you got your
		 information. For example you can enter the name or initials of the researcher or the name of the town where the information
		 was gathered. This might help you later to identify dialectal variants. You can also use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Source</span> field to indicate that the sense was part of an earlier work such as a word list. If you have a bibliographical source for
		 the information, you should put it in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bibliography</span> field (see section <a href="#sBiblioSLFi">6.2.2.8</a>). The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bibliography</span> field is normally included in the dictionary but the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Source</span> field is usually not included. If the source is a previously published dictionary, you should give credit in the introduction
		 to your dictionary. There is no need to give a bibliographical reference in every entry in your dictionary, but you could
		 indicate in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Source</span> field that the current sense was in the prior dictionary. That way you can refer back to it to see what the original entry
		 said.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sUsagesFi"></a>6.2.2.18&nbsp;Usages
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Usages</span> field is used for labels that indicate the pragmatic or sociolinguistic factors that restrict how a lexeme is used. The following
		 sociolinguistic factors can affect the usage of a lexeme. Your language may have some or all of them.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		 <li>Historical factors. Over time lexemes can fall out of usage and new lexemes can be coined or borrowed. If a lexeme is no longer
			used or understood, it can be labeled 'obsolete'. If a lexeme is still understood, but is no longer used, it can be labeled
			'archaic'. If a lexeme is only used by old people, but not by young people, it can be labeled 'old fashioned'. If a lexeme
			has been recently coined, it can be labeled 'neologism'. Unless your language has a long history of literature, your primary
			consideration will be what lexemes are used or at least understood by speakers who are alive today. You may find that older
			speakers remember words that their parents and grandparents used, but that are not used today, even by older speakers.
		 </li>
		 <li>Frequency. If a lexeme is used infrequently, it can be labeled 'rare'.</li>
		 <li>Social status of speaker and listener. Some languages use different lexemes depending on the relative social status of the
			speaker and listener. Linguists or anthropologists may have developed technical labels for such lexemes in your language or
			language family. You can also use labels such as 'honorific', 'respectful', 'familiar', and 'intimate'.
		 </li>
		 <li>Category of speaker and listener. Some languages use different lexemes depending on the category of the speaker and listener.
			If a lexeme is used between men, it can be labeled 'men's speech'. Likewise if it used between women, it can be labeled 'women's
			speech'. If a lexeme is used between people related in a particular way, it can be given a label such as 'same sex siblings'
			or whatever other kinship restrictions might apply. Some languages have taboo restrictions on using a lexeme with particular
			people. Some lexemes are only used when speaking to an animal.
		 </li>
		 <li>Register and style. The social setting may affect which lexemes a person uses. If a lexeme is usually used in a formal setting,
			it can be labeled 'formal'. If it is used in informal settings, it can be labeled 'informal' or 'colloquial'. Some lexicographers
			may prefer to use a scale of register labels such as 'low', 'mid' (or 'basic'), and 'high'. The label 'slang' refers to a
			lexeme used informally by a particular social group (such as teenagers or criminals) either to prevent outsiders from understanding
			what is said, to foster a sense of group membership, or for humorous or other pragmatic effect.
		 </li>
		 <li>Medium. If a lexeme is usually used in written material, it can be labeled 'written' or 'literary'. If it is usually used
			in speaking, it can be labeled 'spoken'.
		 </li>
		 <li>Genre. Some languages have a particular style of speaking that is limited to a particular genre. Some lexemes are primarily
			used in one of these genres. For instance some languages have a traditional story telling style that may be chanted, sung,
			or told in a poetic style. If a lexeme is usually used in poetry, it can be labeled 'poetic'. A lexeme can be limited to other
			genres such as prayer.
		 </li>
		 <li>Correctness. Some lexemes may be considered to be incorrect. This may be because one dialect or sociolect is considered more
			correct than others. For instance in England the variety spoken by the king or queen is considered the correct variety. If
			a lexeme is considered incorrect, it can be labeled 'non-standard'.
		 </li>
		 <li>Propriety. Some lexemes may be considered improper. Many languages have propriety restrictions on lexemes related to various
			aspects of death, birth, sex, defecation, and religion. Some languages have taboo restrictions on what lexemes can be spoken
			in certain situations. If a lexeme is offensive, it can be labeled 'offensive'. If a lexeme is considered very offensive,
			it can be labeled 'obscene'. If a lexeme cannot be spoken, it can be labeled 'taboo'. Propriety restrictions may be limited
			to certain contexts or possibly all contexts. Presumably an improper or taboo lexeme is used in some contexts by some people
			or can be communicated in some way. Otherwise it would be unknown. Euphemisms are created in order to avoid using offensive
			lexemes. In order to fully describe the usage restrictions on improper lexemes, it may be necessary to describe the situations
			in which the lexeme can and cannot be used, the reason for the restriction, and what the consequences would be if someone
			used it in the wrong way.
		 </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Usages</span> field is a list field. You may find that you need to describe the usage of a lexeme using a long phrase rather than a short
		 label. It is possible to create a list item that consists of a phrase such as 'primarily used between men of the same age'.
		 However, If you find that it is better to describe the usage of a lexeme in prose, or if you find that usage issues cannot
		 be handled by a nice neat list, you may need to set up a custom field in which you can describe the usage more fully. Another
		 alternative is to incorporate usage into the definition.
	  </p>
	  <p>You should define each of your usage labels in the introduction to your dictionary. This is especially important if you have
		 cultural or sociological factors that need to be explained to outsiders.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sRevEntriesFi"></a>6.2.2.19&nbsp;Reversal Entries
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Entries</span> field is used to create an entry in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Index</span> for a bilingual dictionary. You can create more than one reversal entry for a sense. For instance the Greek verb <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">s&#333;z&#333;</span> (<span style="font-family:Galatia SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">&#963;&#8180;&#950;&#969;</span>) can be defined as <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'to rescue someone from danger (such as death, sickness, or hell)'</span>. There are several words in English that could be used as translation equivalents for <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">s&#333;z&#333;</span>, including <span style="color:#0000ff; ">rescue</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">save</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">heal</span>, and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">cure</span>. However we have to be careful just putting these words into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Entries</span> field. The Greek word <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">s&#333;z&#333;</span> and the English word can both be used in the frame "Someone <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">s&#333;z&#333;</span>/<span style="color:#0000ff; ">rescues</span> someone from danger." The word <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">s&#333;z&#333;</span> can be used of saving a thing, but is almost always used of saving someone. The same is true of the English word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">rescue</span>. So we can create a reversal entry for resuce without any qualification:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xSozo">(95)</a></td>
			   <td>
				  <table>
					 <tr>
						<td>
						   <div style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; text-indent:-.4in; padding-left:.4in; ">rescue σῴζω</div>
						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>However the English word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">save</span> has more than one meaning, as in the sentence, "I'm saving my money to buy a new computer." So we need to qualify which meaning
		 of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">save</span> is the equivalent of <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">s&#333;z&#333;</span>. We do this by using a phrase:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xSozo2">(96)</a></td>

						   <div style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; text-indent:-.4in; padding-left:.4in; ">save someone from danger σῴζω</div>
						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>Note that we are not trying to define <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">s&#333;z&#333;</span>. We are merely clarifying which meaning of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">save</span> is intended.
	  </p>
	  <p>The word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">heal</span> also has more than one meaning, as in "His wounds healed slowly." So again we need a phrase:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xSozo3">(97)</a></td>

						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>The word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">cure</span> has a slightly different problem. The subject of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">cure</span> is usually a form of treatment as in "The new drug cures tuberculosis." Notice also that the object in this sentence is a
		 disease, not a person. But the word <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">s&#333;z&#333;</span> is used in the frame "Someone <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">s&#333;z&#333;</span> someone from (a disease)." To clarify this we need to use the phrase "for someone to cure someone from a disease." But we
		 need to break it up so that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">cure</span> comes first:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xSozo4">(98)</a></td>

						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>All of this would be entered into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Reversal Entries</span> field as follows:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">

	  </div>
	  <p>Once you have created reversal entries for all the words in your dictionary, you need to check to see if there are any that

	  <p>Use the following principles when developing reversal entries:</p>
	  <ol style="list-style-type:decimal; ">
		 <li>Where will the user look? If he will look there, put an entry there. If he won't look there, don't put an entry there.</li>
		 <li>Start the entry with the important word. Don't start it "to rescue" or "someone rescues..."</li>
		 <li>Translation equivalents are good candidates for reversal entries.</li>
		 <li>If the analysis language word has more than one meaning, specify which meaning is equivalent to the vernacular word.</li>
		 <li>Don't try to define the vernacular word. The definition goes in the dictionary, not the index.</li>
		 <li>Don't try to define the analysis language word. This is an index, not a dictionary.</li>
	  </ol>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sSenseTypeFi"></a>6.2.2.20&nbsp;Sense Type
	  </h4>
	  <p>The Sense Type field is used to label different kinds of senses. Many lexemes have a basic sense and one or more figurative
		 senses that have been created by metaphorical extension. For instance the basic meaning of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">family</span> in English is <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'a father, mother, and their children'</span>. But it also has a secondary sense <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'any group of things, especially plants, animals, or languages, that share characteristics or are considered to be derived
			from a common source'</span>. The second sense could be given the label 'metaphorical extension'. Similarly the primary meaning of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">fly</span> is <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'(for a bird) to use its wings to move through the air'</span>. But it has a 'figurative' meaning <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'to move quickly'</span>, as in "She flew by as if someone were chasing her."
	  </p>
	  <p>There are several difficulties in labeling sense types. First, there does not seem to be a good theoretical basis for distinguishing
		 between "literal" and "figurative" senses. There seems to be some basis for claiming that a sense that refers to a physical
		 object, action, or quality is somehow more basic than a non-physical sense. So the meaning of slip in "His foot slipped,"
		 is considered to be more basic than "His standards have slipped."
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sAcadDomFi"></a>6.2.2.21&nbsp;Academic Domains
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Academic Domains</span> field is used to link the sense to one or more academic domains. It can be used to classify a sense of a lexeme that is relevant
		 to some academic field. It is also an excellent way to label technical terms in your language and indicate what specialized
		 field the term is used in. You can use the list of academic domains to classify all the words of your language. However there
		 is a whole lot more to life than academics. So it would be better to use the list of semantic domains to classify your entire
		 lexicon. The list of academic domains is maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists-Academic Domains</span> area.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sSemDomFi"></a>6.2.2.22&nbsp;Semantic Domains
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Semantic Domains</span> field is used to link the sense to one or more semantic domains. The list of semantic domains is maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists-Semantic Domains</span> area. The list that comes packaged with Language Explorer is the Dictionary Development Process (DDP) list. It is the same
		 list that is used in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Collect Words</span> area.
	  </p>
	  <p>There is a tool in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Choose Semantic Domains</span> dialog box called <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Suggest</span>. It will suggest possible semantic domains for the word, based on what you have entered in the the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Gloss</span> field.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sAnthroDomFi"></a>6.2.2.23&nbsp;Anthropology Categories
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Anthropology Categories</span> field is used to link the sense to one or more anthropology categories. The list of anthropology categories is maintained
		 in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists-Anthropology Categories</span> area. The list that comes packaged with Language Explorer is the standard Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), also known as
		 the Organization of Cultural Materials (OCM), that is used to organize anthropology field notes and files. If you use the
		 FieldWorks Data Notebook to record cultural observations, you can search both your notes in Data Notebook and your dictionary
		 entries for information on one of the anthropology categories.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sStatusFi"></a>6.2.2.24&nbsp;Status
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Status</span> field is used to label the status of the sense. Since the development of a dictionary frequently takes several years or even
		 decades, it is useful to have some record of what work you have done on a sense or how much progress you have made. You can
		 use this field to indicate who worked on the sense, whether or not you are happy with the work, whether it still needs to
		 be checked, whether it conforms to your style guide, whether or not the sense is approved for publication, etc.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Status</span> field is a list field and the list is maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists-Sense Status</span> area. Do not confuse the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Sense Status</span> field with the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Status</span> field in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists</span> area, which is used to indicate the status of list items.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sLexRelFi"></a>6.2.2.25&nbsp;Lexical Relations
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexical Relations</span> field is used to link the current sense with a sense of another lexeme. There are various types of lexical relations. The
		 two that are most familiar to people are 'synonym' and 'antonym'. The list of lexical relations is maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists-Lexical Relations</span> area. You can add to this list to meet your needs.
	  </p>
	  <p>Linguists and lexicographers have noted for a long time that lexemes are related to one another in various ways. A number
		 of linguists have proposed lists of commonly occurring lexical relations. For instance the pairs of words <span style="color:#0000ff; ">runner:run</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">builder:build</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">creator:create</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">cook:cook</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff; ">pilot:fly</span> are all related by the lexical relation Typical Agent:Activity. Note that some, but not all, of the nouns are derived by
		 the addition of the derivational affix <span style="color:#0000ff; ">-er/-or</span>. This is because the relation is semantic, not morphological. When we link lexemes together, we must be careful to analyze
		 the semantics carefully. Note that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">bird:fly</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">pilot:fly</span> appear to be the same lexical relation. But actually <span style="color:#0000ff; ">fly</span> has more than one meaning. <span style="color:#0000ff; ">Bird</span> is related to one sense and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">pilot</span> to another. This becomes apparent when we look at the syntax of the sentences <span style="color:#0000ff; ">"The bird flew away,"</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff; ">"The pilot flew the airplane."</span> The first sense of <span style="color:#0000ff; ">fly</span> <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'(of a bird, insect, or bat) to move through the air using its wings'</span> is intransitive and the second <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'to operate (an airplane)'</span> is transitive.

	  </h4>
	  <p>When you import data into Language Explorer, any data that does not map into one of the Language Explorer fields will be placed
		 in one of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Import Residue</span> fields. If the data relates to a particular sense, it will be put in the sense level <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Import Residue</span> field for that sense. If it relates to the entire entry, it will be put into the entry level <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Import Residue</span> field. You can use <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Bulk Copy</span> or <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Click Copy</span> to move data from the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Import Residue</span> field to any field you choose.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sVarSectFi"></a>6.2.3&nbsp;Variants section
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section is used to enter variants of the current lexeme. This assumes that the current lexeme is the basic form and that
		 the forms entered here are variants of it. If the current lexeme is a variant, you should not use this section. Instead you
		 should use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Of</span> field on the entry level to link the current (variant) lexeme to the basic form.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section is also used to enter irregularly inflected forms. Language Explorer handles variants and irregularly inflected forms
		 in the same way. So whenever the program refers to "variants", you should understand it to be talking about irregularly inflected
		 forms as well.
	  </p>
	  <p>To add a variant, click somewhere on the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> line, and then click the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Insert Variant</span> link. The Find Variant dialog box comes up, which enables you to type the form of the variant. If the variant is already
		 in the database, Language Explorer creates a link between the entry for the basic form and the entry for the variant. If the
		 variant is not yet in the database, Language Explorer creates an entry for it and links the two entries.
	  </p>
	  <p>For each variant Language Explorer creates a bundle of four fields--<span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Form</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Type</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Show Minor Entry</span>, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Comment</span>. You should enter the variant in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Form</span> field, specify what kind of variant it is in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Type</span> field, and then indicate if you want Language Explorer to create a minor entry for the variant by clicking the check box
		 in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Show Minor Entry</span> field. You can also add a note to yourself about the variant in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Comment</span> field. You can add additional variants by repeating this same procedure.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer creates a separate entry for each variant. This enables you to add extra information about the variant.
		 The information from this section is copied into the entry for the variant. You will find each of these fields in the variant
		 entry on the entry level. You can edit the fields in either entry and the information will be copied to the other entry. To
		 show you how all this works I have put two entries side by side in the example below. On the left is the entry for the basic
		 form. On the right is the entry for the variant. (The entries are two forms of the name for the city of Jerusalem in Koine
		 Greek.<span style="font-size:65%; vertical-align:super">[<a href="#nJerusalem">13</a>]</span>) The lines connect the corresponding fields in the two entries. The green lines point to the basic form. The red lines point
		 to the variant form. The yellow lines connect the three fields that are copied from one entry to the other.

	  <h4 style=""><a name="sVarFormVSFi"></a>6.2.3.1&nbsp;Variant Form
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Form</span> field displays the form of a variant. When you use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section to add a variant, Language Explorer creates a separate entry for the variant and places the form of the variant in
		 the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field of the other entry. It also places the form of the variant here in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Form</span> field of the entry for the basic form. In example <a href="#xJerusalem">(104)</a> the red line connects the two fields. The two fields are copies of each other. A change in one field will also be made in
		 the other field, because Language Explorer treats them both as a single object in the database.
	  </p>
	  <p>Language Explorer also puts the headword from this entry into the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Of</span> field of the other entry. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Of</span> field is located on the entry level of the variant entry. In example <a href="#xJerusalem">(104)</a> the green line connects the two fields. So you can think of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Form</span> field and the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Of</span> field as complementary fields. If you right click on either of the two fields, you can jump to the other entry. This enables
		 you to quickly navigate between the basic form and the variant.

	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Type</span> field is used to specify what type of variant is in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Form</span> field. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Type</span> field here in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variants</span> section of the basic form entry corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Type</span> field on the entry level in the entry for the variant. In example <a href="#xJerusalem">(104)</a> the first yellow line connects the two fields in the two entries. You can specify the variant type of the variant in either
		 place. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Variant Type</span> field is a list field. The list is maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lists-Variant Types</span> area.

	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Show Minor Entry</span> field is used to specify whether or not you want Language Explorer to create a minor entry for the variant. If this field
		 is checked, Language Explorer will automatically create a minor entry for the variant. This field corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Show Minor Entry</span> field in the entry for the variant. In example <a href="#xJerusalem">(104)</a> the second yellow line connects the two fields in the two entries. You can change this field in either entry.

This field corresponds to the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Comment</span> field in the entry for the variant.

	  <h3 style=""><a name="sAlloSectFi"></a>6.2.4&nbsp;Allomorphs section
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Allomorphs</span> section is used to enter and constrain allomorphs of the lexeme. The primary or default allomorph should be entered in the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field and constrained (if necessary) there. To add an allomorph click on the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Allomorphs</span> line and then click the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Insert Allomorph</span> link. Language Explorer will insert a bundle of five fields--<span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Stem Allomorph</span> (or <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Affix Allomorph</span>), <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Is Abstract Form</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span>, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Environments</span>, and <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Stem Name</span>. The last four fields also occur on the entry level following the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field. You can add additional allomorphs by clicking again on <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Insert Allomorph</span>.

	  <h4 style=""><a name="sAllomorphFi"></a>6.2.4.1&nbsp;Stem Allomorph, Affix Allomorph
	  </h4>
	  <p>The name of this field varies depending on the choice you made in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field. If you chose one of the affix types, this field will be called <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Affix Allomorph</span>. But if you chose one of the root, stem, or phrase types, this field will be called <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Stem Allomorph</span>. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Stem/Affix Allomorph</span> field is used to enter the form of an allomorph.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sIsAbsFormAFFi"></a>6.2.4.2&nbsp;Is Abstract Form (of allomorph)
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Is Abstract Form</span> field is used to indicate whether an allomorph is an abstract form or an orthographic form. Some linguists want to enter
		 an abstract form in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Lexeme Form</span> field, the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Stem Allomorph</span> field, or the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Affix Allomorph</span> field. To prevent the parser from trying to use an abstract form, you should put a check in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Is Abstract Form</span> field. For more on abstract forms see section <a href="#sIsAbsFormFi">6.2.1.2</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sMorphTyAFFi"></a>6.2.4.3&nbsp;Morph Type (of allomorph)
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Morph Type</span> field is used to indicate the morpheme type of the allomorph. For more on morpheme types see section <a href="#sMorphemeTypes">5.5.12</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sEnvironAFFi"></a>6.2.4.4&nbsp;Environments (of allomorph)
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Environments</span> field is used to specify one or more phonological environments that this allomorph can occur in. For more on environments
		 see <a href="#sEnvironFi">6.2.1.4</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sStemNameAFFi"></a>6.2.4.5&nbsp;Stem Name
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Stem Name</span> field is used to label an allomorph that is conditioned by a grammatical context rather than a phonological context. For
		 more on stem names see <a href="#sStemNameFi">6.2.1.5</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h3 style=""><a name="sGramInfoDetFi"></a>6.2.5&nbsp;Grammatical Info. Details (for stems)
	  </h3>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info Details</span> section is used to store each of the grammatical categories that you have used in the entry. A lexeme can have senses that
		 belong to different grammatical categories. For instance the word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">love</span> can be both a verb (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">He loves me</span>.) and a noun (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">His love for me means so much</span>.). The word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">along</span> can be used as a preposition (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">We walked along the river.</span>) and as an adverb (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">Do you want to go along?</span>). Each grammatical category used in the entry is stored in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info Details</span> section and can be used for more than one sense.
	  </p>
	  <p>The grammatical information for a sense includes more than just the category. So each category includes a bundle of associated
		 fields. The grammatical category itself goes in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category Info</span> field and each bundle includes an <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Class</span> field, <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Features</span> field, and an <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Exception "Features"</span> field. When you assign a grammatical category to a sense, you are actually assigning the entire bundle to the sense. This
		 is why the grammatical field on the sense level is called <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span> and not just "Grammatical Category".
	  </p>
	  <p>Once you have described the grammatical information for a sense by filling out each of the fields in the bundle, you can reuse
		 the bundle for other senses. You can also create a new bundle. You create a new bundle by adding a new sense. Then in the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span> field on the sense level you must assign the sense to a grammatical category instead of the previous bundle. Language Explorer
		 then creates a new bundle in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info Details</span> section. You can only fill out the other fields in the bundle in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info Details</span> section. If you then create a third sense, you can assign it to one of the bundles you already have, or you can create a
		 third bundle by assigning the sense to a grammatical category.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sCatInfoFi"></a>6.2.5.1&nbsp;Category Info.
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category Info</span> field is used to specify the grammatical category of a sense. Usually you would specify the grammatical category of a lexeme
		 when you create the entry. For instance the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">New Entry</span> dialog box has a place to indicate the grammatical category. When you do this, Language Explorer creates an entry with a
		 single sense and assigns the grammatical category to the first sense. You can also specify the grammatical category of a sense
		 in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammatical Info</span> field on the sense level. If you use either of these methods, the grammatical category will be displayed in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category Info</span> field. However if you have not yet indicated the grammatical category, you can do so in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category Info</span> field. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Category Info</span> field is a list field. The list is maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar-Category Edit</span> area.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sInflClassFi"></a>6.2.5.2&nbsp;Inflection Class
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Class</span> field is used to assign a lexeme (or more properly a sense of a lexeme) to an inflection class. An inflection class is a
		 subset of a grammatical category that uses a unique set of inflectional affixes. For instance the English nouns that form
		 their plural by adding -s (e.g. boy/boys, dog/dogs) form an inflection class. The nouns that form their plural by changing
		 their vowel (e.g. man/men, goose/geese) form a second inflection class. You must create and maintain a list of inflection
		 classes for each grammatical category in your language that has inflection classes. The lists are maintained in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Grammar-Category Edit</span> area under the relevant grammatical category. If your language does not have inflection classes, you can ignore this field.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Class</span> field is used by the parser to correctly analyze inflected words. Most dictionaries indicate the inflection class of a word
		 in the entry. Most native speakers of a language know the inflection class of a word. However children may not know it. Even
		 adults may not know the correct inflection class of a rare or archaic word. For instance the Merriam-Webster Dictionary entry
		 for <span style="color:#0000ff; ">goose</span> handles it this way:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xGoose">(105)</a></td>
			   <td>
				  <table>
					 <tr>
						<td>
						   <div style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; text-indent:-.4in; padding-left:.4in; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">goose</span> <span style="font-style:italic; ">n, pl</span> <span style="font-weight:bold; ">geese</span> <span style="font-weight:bold; ">1 :</span> a large web-footed bird related to the swans and ducks...
						   </div>
						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>To produce this in Language Explorer you would need to set up a custom field for the plural form and use <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Dictionary</span> to insert "pl" before the contents of the field. The other alternative is to use <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Dictionary</span> to print the contents of the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Class</span> field. Since the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Class</span> field contains a class label and not the actual inflected form, this is not an especially good option. For instance the inflection
		 class that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">goose</span> belongs to might be labeled "vowel replacement plural." In Language Explorer this would come out like this:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		 <table>
			<tr>
			   <td valign="top"><a name="xGoose2">(106)</a></td>
			   <td>
				  <table>
					 <tr>
						<td>
						   <div style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; text-indent:-.4in; padding-left:.4in; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">goose</span> <span style="font-style:italic; ">N vowel replacement plural</span> <span style="font-weight:bold; ">1)</span> a large web-footed bird related to the swans and ducks...
						   </div>
						</td>
					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>This kind of label is not especially helpful for users who aren't linguists, which is why most dictionaries opt to use inflected
		 forms to indicate inflection classes. For more on inflection classes see Andy Black's paper "Introduction to Parsing" in the
		 <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help-Resourses</span> menu.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style=""><a name="sInflFeaturesFi"></a>6.2.5.3&nbsp;Inflection Features
	  </h4>
	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Inflection Features</span> field is used to assign an inflection feature to a lexeme (or more properly to a sense of a lexeme). An inflection feature
		 is associated with a subset of a grammatical category that uses a unique set of inflectional affixes. Inflection features
		 are also involved in syntactic agreement. The features sometimes correspond to broad semantic classes. In contrast, inflection
		 classes are not involved in syntactic agreement nor do they correspond to semantic classes. Not all languages have inflection
		 features. English has no inflection features, so it is necessary to use another language to illustrate how they work. Consider
		 the following Greek words:

	  <p>All Greek nouns have an inflection feature--gender, of which there are three values--feminine, masculine, and neuter. They
		 also have case suffixes that indicate their syntactic role in the clause. The chart above gives an example of a noun from
		 each of the three genders. Each noun is given with three (of the five) case suffixes--nominative, genitive, and neuter. The
		 important thing to notice is that the form of the definite article is affected by the gender (and case) of the noun. In other
		 words there is agreement between the form of the article and the gender of the noun. Notice also that there is no difference
		 in the case suffixes of feminine and masculine nouns. However the nominative of neuter nouns has no suffix. So there is a
		 difference in the case suffixes of neuter nouns. This is typical of inflection features. The affixes on the word can vary
		 depending on the inflection feature, and other words take different affixes depending on the inflection feature of the noun
		 (or other word) that owns the inflection feature.
	  </p>
	  <p>How do we handle this in a dictionary? In order to correctly inflect a Greek noun, it is necessary to know its gender. So
		 we must somehow indicate the gender of each noun in the dictionary. This can be accomplished in three ways. First, sometimes
		 the gender can be indicated by the form of the noun. Some Greek derivational affixes determine the gender. For instance adding
		 the derivational suffix <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">-mat</span> (cognate with English <span style="color:#0000ff; ">-ment</span>) results in a noun that is neuter. The Greek noun <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">gramma</span> (<span style="font-family:Galatia SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#956;&#945;</span>) <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'letter'</span> (from which we get our word <span style="color:#0000ff; ">grammar</span>) is formed from the root <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">graph</span> (<span style="color:#0000ff; ">&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;</span>) and the suffix <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">-mat</span>. (The stem is <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">grammat-</span>, but the final <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">t</span> is deleted in the nominative because of a phonological rule.) At least to a speaker of Greek, the following entry indicates
		 that <span style="color:#0000ff; ">gramma</span> is a neuter noun. The fact that it is neuter is obvious from the citation form <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">gramma</span>, which is nominative, together with the genitive form <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">grammatos</span>, which follows it.

	  <p>Unfortunately merely giving the form of the word does not always indicate the gender. The second way to indicate it is to
		 add a label for the inflection feature after the grammatical category. Greek dictionaries sometimes do this by combining the
		 grammatical category with the gender, as in 'nf' (noun-feminine), 'nm' (noun-masculine), or 'nn' (noun-neuter). The following
		 masculine noun <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">grammateus</span> is an example.

	  <p>However labels are often meaningless to users who are not linguists. So a third way to indicate the inflection feature is
		 to add another word that agrees with the noun. In Greek dictionaries this is sometimes done by adding the correct form of
		 the article. In the following entry for <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">graph&#275;</span> the noun is feminine and this fact is indicated by the word <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">h&#275;</span> (<span style="font-family:Galatia SIL; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#0000ff; ">&#7969;</span>), which is the nominative feminine form of the definite article <span style="font-family:SansSerif; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; color:#009900; ">'the'</span>.

	  <p>Bantu languages also have inflection features associated with the nouns. In Bantu linguistics these are usually called "noun
		 classes." However they are inflection features, not inflection classes, because they are involved in agreement rules with
		 other words in the clause. Bantu language dictionaries usually handle them in one of two ways. The first way is to give both
		 the singular and plural forms of the noun. This is similar to the first option given above for Greek. The following Lugungu
		 word illustrates this option:
	  </p>
	  <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">

					 </tr>
				  </table>
			   </td>
			</tr>
		 </table>
	  </div>
	  <p>To do this you would need to set up a custom field for the plural form. The second option is to include the inflection feature
		 after the grammatical category. This is similar to the second option given above for Greek. In Bantu linguistics the "noun
		 class" is indicated by two numbers. The first indicates what affix is used for the singular and the second indicates what
		 affix is used for the plural. In Language Explorer the "1/2" would be the label for the inflection feature.

	  <p>The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Exception "Features"</span> field is used to assign an exception feature to stems and affixes. The <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Exception "Features"</span> field is used by the parser to eliminate bad analyses. Some languages have affixes that can occur on some stems, but not
		 others. If you have such an affix, you would create an exception feature and assign it to the affix. Then you would assign
		 the same exception feature to each stem that takes the affix. The parser will then only allow the affix to cooccur with those
		 stems that have the exception feature. I do not know of any dictionaries that include exception features. However you can
		 use the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Configure Dictionary</span> tool to include them if you want. For more on exception features see Andy Black's paper "Introduction to Parsing" in the

	  <p>The <span style="color:#0000ff; ">-ion</span> suffix only occurs on roots and stems that have been borrowed from Latin. That is the reason for the "Latinate" exception
		 feature. The "From" root (or stem) must be Latinate, and the resulting "To" stem is also Latinate. So the exception feature
		 must be in both fields.
	  </p>
	  <p>Derivational affixes often change the root <span style="font-style:italic; ">from</span> one grammatical category <span style="font-style:italic; ">to</span> a different grammatical category. This is the reason why there is a set of fields that start with "From" and a second set
		 that start with "To." The "From" fields describe the grammatical category of the root, and the "To" fields describe the grammatical
		 category of the resulting stem.
	  </p>
	  <p>It is highly unlikely that any of these fields would be displayed in a published dictionary. The only exception is the grammatical
		 category, as in example <a href="#xIon">(114)</a>. For more on derivational affixes see Andy Black's paper "Introduction to Parsing" in the <span style="color:#000099; font-weight:bold; ">Help-Resources</span> menu.

				  of lexemes. Then you can use the Bulk Edit tools to strip off affixes. Once you have reduced the words to the correct citation
				  form, you can export it, merge duplicate entries (this can be done with the DDP CC table mergerec.cc), and import it into
				  your permanent dictionary project.

			   <p>There is a way to automatically classify words using Consistent Changes tables. It works by matching an English gloss in your
				  dictionary to the sample words in the DDP materials. Tests have shown that it can successfully classify 60-70% of the senses
				  in a dictionary. However this requires that you export your dictionary from Language Explorer, run the CC tables, then reimport
				  your dictionary. The CC tables cannot distinguish homonyms and multiple senses of a word. So there will be mistakes in the
				  output that have to be corrected.

			   <p>The word 'Jerusalem' was borrowed from Hebrew into Greek. The basic form is the form that was adapted to the phonology of
				  Greek and would be the form that was used by most speakers of Greek. The variant form is transliterated from Hebrew and probably
				  was pronounced close to or the same as the original Hebrew word. It was used by Jews living in Jerusalem and Judea who considered
				  the city to be sacred. Some of the writers of the New Testament use both forms and the rules governing which form to use are
				  quite complex and interesting.
