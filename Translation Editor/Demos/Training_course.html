<h1>Training course</h1>
<p>In the training course, you <strong>practice skills</strong> to translate Scripture into a vernacular language.</p>
<p>The course requires only one or two days. It does not teach everything you can do in Translation Editor.</p>
<h3>Open course documents</h3>
<p>On the <span class="UserInterface">Help</span> menu of the Translation Editor window, point to <span class="UserInterface">Training</span>, and then click any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="UserInterface">Student Manual</span>: In each module, follow the numbered steps and check your work using the screen shots.</p>
<p>A small story or scenario illustrates why the skills are important and when to use them.</p>
<p>The realistic data consists of selected translation drafts in Sena, a Bantu language spoken in Mozambique. Some of the data is deliberately in its raw form to reflect the flavor of Scripture translation work in progress.</p>
<p>If you are a self-paced learner, we recommend that you view the <a href="index.html">demos</a> for a module before you practice the skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="UserInterface">Exercises</span>: For more practice, do the exercises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="UserInterface">Copy-and-paste Data</span>: To minimize typing time, you can copy text from the file when you practice some skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="UserInterface">Instructor Guide</span>: Before you teach the course or take the course as a self-paced learner, read about the prerequisites and instructional method.</p>
</li>
</ul>
