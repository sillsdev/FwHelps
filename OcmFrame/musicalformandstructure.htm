  <h2>5331f Musical form and structure</h2>
<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Description</h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>The Outline of Cultural Materials gives "scale, pitch, tone, tempo, rhythm" as elements of musical form. Musical form interpreted  as scale, pitch, etc., is a way of considering musical form, but musical form in a composition. An in-depth study of musical elements requires they be studied separately, so each element is listed as a separate number.</P>
<P>For the sake of clarity, "musical form" is taken here to refer to "form of music" which deals with the overall structural scheme of a musical composition. </P>
