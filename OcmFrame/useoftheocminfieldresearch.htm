<h2>Use of the OCM in Field Research</h2>
<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading> </h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>Though not designed as a field manual, the OCM has been found a useful aid in the field. It calls attention to a very wide range of cultural, social, and background phenomena, some portions of which are all too often omitted in descriptive accounts. Moreover, its descriptive sections can suggest leads for inquiry that might otherwise be overlooked. Finally, it provides a useful system for the classification of field notes, bringing together data gathered at different times from different informants that would be widely scattered in a notebook, and thus drawing attention to inconsistencies and problems that demand clarification on the spot. Field workers should be warned, however, that no culture will fit precisely into the framework of the OCM, and should be prepared to modify the system of classification freely in adjustment to exigencies in the local situation. Under no circumstances should they organize the published report of their findings in slavish accordance with the sections and categories of the OCM.</P>
<P>When used as a field manual, the OCM presents an interesting contrast to the Royal Anthropological Institute's manual, <I>Notes and Queries in Anthropology</I>. The two manuals differ greatly in approach and content. Of course, <I>Notes and Queries</I> was specifically designed as a field research guide, whereas the OCM was developed primarily for the classification of documentary data. Perhaps for that reason, these manuals serve distinct but complementary functions, and the fieldworker may find both to be of value.</P>
<P>In instances where fieldwork is undertaken in societies for which HRAF has processed the earlier sources, a careful preliminary study of the material in the File should pay rich dividends. It will save the researcher from duplicating the sound work of his predecessors and reveal gaps that need to be filled. Above all, perhaps, it will call attention to inconsistencies that should be reconciled and to important problems which demand a solution.</P>
