  <h2>5331h Musical texture (harmony)</h2>
<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Description</h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>Musical texture refers to both the horizontal and vertical relationships of musical materials. Western music usually assumes some sort of harmony if there are more than two parts. Western harmony may not exist in non-Western music, but the terms may be useful in describing horizontal relationships.   </P>
