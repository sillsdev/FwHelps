<h2>History of Projects Using the OCM at the Human Relations Area Files  </h2>
<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Cross-Cultural Survey   </h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>The OCM was originally developed as a tool for the Cross-Cultural Survey, an organization established in 1937 by the Institute of Human Relations at Yale University as part of its program of interdisciplinary research in the social sciences. Under the direction of George P. Murdock, and after 1945 of Clellan S. Ford, this organization engaged in assembling and classifying the basic information on a sample of the peoples of the earth. Its ultimate objective was to organize in readily accessible form the available data on a statistically representative sample of all known cultures-primitive, historical, and contemporary-for the purpose of testing cross-cultural generalizations, revealing deficiencies in the descriptive literature, and directing corrective field work.</P>
<P>By 1943 the Survey had excerpted from the literature, translated into English where necessary, classified according to the system of the OCM and systematically filed some 500,000 slips with full or substantial information on nearly 150 cultures. Although most of these represented primitive peoples in all parts of the world, a number of Files had been assembled on more complex civilizations, including a few modern communities and such historical societies as the Imperial Romans and the Elizabethan English.</P>
<P>This body of materials was sufficient for preliminary comparative studies, and a number were undertaken by members of the research staff of the Institute of Human Relations. Among those publications that soon became "classics" are the following:</P>
<UL type=disc>
<LI>Ford, C. S. "A Comparative Study of Human Reproduction."  <I>Yale University Publications in Anthropology,</I> XXXII, 1-111.  1945.  </LI>
<LI>Horton, D.  "The Functions of Alcohol in Primitive Societies: A Cross-Cultural Study."  <I>Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol,</I> IV, 199-320.  1943.  </LI>
<LI>Murdock, G. P.  <I>Social Structure.</I>  New York: Macmillan, 1949.  </LI>
</UL>
<P>In addition, the Survey attracted an increasing number of scholars in various fields to New Haven to utilize its resources in their own research</P>
<P>After the entry of the United States into World War II, the Cross-Cultural Survey concentrated its efforts largely on areas of probable combat operations, especially in the Pacific. With its budget from the Institute of Human Relations expanded by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation, it assembled considerable information which proved useful to national war agencies. In addition, from materials in its Files it published a series of seven <I>Strategic Bulletins of Oceania</I> on such subjects as meteorology, food and water supply, and the distribution of diseases. These were widely distributed by the Ethnogeographic Board of the Smithsonian Institution.</P>
</div>
<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Strategic Index of the Americas   </h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>The increasing use of the Files by government agencies, who frequently sent representatives to NewHaven for specific information on particular areas and topics, brought the Survey to the attention of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. This agency entered into a contract with Yale University by which was established, on July 1, 1942, the Strategic Index of Latin America, subsequently renamed the Strategic Index of the Americas. A staff was assembled, and the cultures and subcultures of Latin America were classified into approximately one hundred regional units. Using this classification and the <I>Outline of Cultural Materials</I>, the Strategic Index processed, before it was discontinued on September 30, 1943, an estimated third of the major sources on the geography and civilization of modern Latin America. In all, 488 sources totaling 22,663 pages were completely processed and 249 additional sources were translated or compiled in manuscript form but remained unprocessed at the conclusion of the project. Besides excerpting text material, the Index reproduced for the Files all relevant maps, charts, and photographs. It also issued fifteen factual and informative bulletins, including bibliographies, glossaries, and special reports on such subjects as geology, useful flora, food, health, and settlements.</P>

<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Navy Project   </h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>The usefulness of the material in the Cross-Cultural Survey Files on the then Japanese-held islands of the Pacific led the United States Navy Department, in 1943, to contract with Yale University for the continuation of the work on an expanded scale. In addition, three members of the staff received commissions and were assigned the task of organizing the information in the Files, largely from Japanese and other foreign-language sources, in the form of practical handbooks for military government officers. Between August 1943 and November 1944 nine of these <I>Military Government Handbooks</I> were published, covering the Marshall, Caroline, Marianas, Izu, Bonin, Kurile, and Ryukyu Islands. Since the war these handbooks have been declassified and made available for distribution to civilian scholars by the Chief of Naval Operations, Office of Island Governments, Navy Department, Washington, D.C.</P>

<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Nebraska Project   </h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>During 1946 and 1947 the University of Nebraska, in cooperation with the Institute of Human Relations at Yale, conducted a special project for assembling information on the Plains Indians.  Using the <I>Outline of Cultural Materials,</I> this project, under the direction of Dr. John M. Roberts, produced complete Files on ten Plains tribes, of which copies are available at both institutions.  </P>

<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Human Relations Area Files, Inc.  </h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>Despite its wide utility, the Cross-Cultural Survey possessed the serious disadvantage that the only complete File was located in one place, which was remote from many institutions of learning.  During 1948 and 1949 the Social Science Research Council, in collaboration with the Carnegie Corporation, undertook to explore the possibilities of duplicating the Files for wider distribution and of continuing the work on a broader basis.  Following a careful  assessment of the Survey by Dr. Brewster Smith of the Harvard Department of Social Relations, and a demonstration of interest from a number of institutions, an inter-university organization called HRAF (Human Relations Area Files, Inc.) was established and began operations on October 1, 1949.  Controlled by a Board of Directors representing the participating institutions, HRAF was established for the purpose of producing cross-cultural Files for its members through a grant from the Carnegie Corporation and processing and distributing additional materials through contributions from its participants and foundations.  Among the founding institutions in 1949 were:   </P>
<UL type=disc>
<LI>University of Chicago   </LI>
<LI>Harvard University   </LI>
<LI>University of North Carolina   </LI>
<LI>University of Oklahoma   </LI>
<LI>University of Pennsylvania   </LI>
<LI>University of Southern California   </LI>
<LI>University of Washington   </LI>
<LI>Yale University   </LI>
</UL>
<P>A collection of ethnography, subject-indexed by the OCM categories, become known as the "HRAF Files" and was distributed to member institutions. Now that HRAF has two collections-one in ethnography, the other in archaeology-we have changed the names to the HRAF Collection of Ethnography and the HRAF Collection of Archaeology (see descriptions below in the section on the HRAF Collections.   </P>
