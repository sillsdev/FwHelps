<h2>Types of Categories   </h2>
<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading> </h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>Perhaps the chief theoretical assumption affecting the organization of
 the OCM is the recognition that any element of culture may have as many
as seven major facets, any one of which can be taken as the primary basis
of classification. Each of the seven is extensively used in the descriptive
literature, and all seven have been employed in defining at least some of
the categories in the OCM.</P>
<P>Every element of culture involves, in the first place, a <U>patterned activity</U>,
i.e., a customary norm of motor, verbal, or implicit (covert or ideational)
behavior. The nature of such an activity is the primary basis of classification
for such categories as 484 (Travel), 521 (Conversation), and 764 (Crime).</P>
<P>Secondly, an activity is normally considered appropriate only under certain
<U>circumstances,</U> e.g., of time or place. Categories like 221 (Annual Cycle)
or 527 (Rest Days and Holidays) embrace varied activities linked by their
occurrence under similar circumstances.</P>
<P>In the third place, customary activities are frequently associated with
a particular <U>subject,</U> i.e., a culturally defined class of persons, the occupants
of a particular status, or the members of a specified social group. Categories
like 462 (Division of Labor by Gender), 614 (Sibs), and 793 (Priesthood)
depend more upon who performs an activity than upon what activity is performed
or the circumstances of its performance.</P>
<P>Fourthly, an activity is commonly directed toward some <U>object,</U> which may
be an inanimate thing, an animal, or a person. Such categories as 231 (Domesticated
animals), 252 (Food Preparation), 602 (Kin Relationships), and 855 (Child
Care) are oriented primarily around the objects of activities.</P>
<P>In the fifth place, many activities are accomplished by the use of some
<U>means</U> external to both the subject and the object, e.g., an artifact or a
 human assistant. Categories like 206 (Telephone and Telegraph) and 411
(Weapons) are defined basically by means of the first type; those like 476
(Mutual Aid) and 676 (Agency) by means of the second type.</P>
<P>Sixthly, activities are normally performed with a <U>purpose</U> or goal in mind.
It is the purpose, rather than any other criterion, which determines whether
a particular item shall be assigned to such a category as 211 (Mnemonic
Devices), 754 (Sorcery), or 861 (Techniques of Socialization).</P>
<P>Finally, an activity commonly has some concrete <U>result,</U> affecting the subject,
the object, or both. The result often corresponds closely to the purpose,
especially in technological activities. The two, however, may bear no relationship
to each other. In the case of sorcery, for example, the purpose is to injure
the object, but the usual result probably is merely to gratify or allay
the aggressive impulses in the subject. Categories like 396 (Shipbuilding)
and 681 (Sanctions) are defined primarily in terms of the results of activities.</P>
<P>To give full and separate expression to each of the above seven principles,
though theoretically possible, would produce an intolerably cumbersome system
of classification, and would seriously fragment the descriptive materials.
The authors have consequently chosen in most instances to follow the sources,
in which commonsense categories predominate. These reflect now one principle
of classification, now another, oftentimes two or more in combination. When
alternative principles are in widespread use, these are recognized, even
though they sometimes lead to assigning similar data to different categories.
The same process of fashioning an iron blade, for example, might be filed
under either 325 (Metallurgy), 326 (Smiths and their Crafts), or 391 (Hardware
Manufacture), depending upon whether the particular source treated it from
the point of view of the object (iron), the subject (smith), or the result
(tool).</P>
<P>Some authors organize their data into broader or more abstract categories
than do others. The OCM adopts a number of these, e.g., 181 (Ethos), 463
(Occupational Specialization), 511 (Standard of Living). It should be emphasized,
however, that broad categories of this type will normally include only data
thus organized in the sources, and that much pertinent information on such
topics will be found only under the more specific categories employed in
other sources.</P>
<P>To avoid overloading certain categories with masses of descriptive detail
about the artifacts employed as means in the particular cultural activity,
or produced as results thereof, it has seemed advisable to reserve a number
of categories specifically for such descriptive data. The most important
of these are found in Sections 290 (Clothing) <SUP><a href="note3.htm">3</a></SUP> ,
 340 (Structures), 400 (Machines), 410 (Tools and Appliances), and 710 (Military
Technology).</P>
<P>Some categories, e.g., those of Sections 770 (Religious Beliefs) and 820
(Ideas about Nature and People), are reserved primarily for symbolic or
ideational behavior. A number are concerned almost exclusively with organized
social relationships and groups, e.g., those in Sections 470 (Business and
Industrial Organization), 610 (Kin Groups), 640 (State), 700 (Armed Forces),
and 790 (Ecclesiastical Organization).</P>
<P>A major distinction should be noted between those categories--the great
majority-which describe the behavior, culture, or social structure of a
people as it appears equally to the native and the outside observer, and
other categories which present interpretations or conclusions involving
a level of scientific knowledge and abstraction possible only in a highly
trained observer. The latter type includes most of the categories in Sections
130 through 190 and such others as 435 (Price and Value), 511 (Standard
of Living), 781 (Religious Experience), and 811 (Logic).</P>
