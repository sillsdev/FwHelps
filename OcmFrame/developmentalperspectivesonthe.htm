<h2>Developmental perspectives on the OCM   </h2>
<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading> </h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
	<P>In 1971, two articles were published in HRAFs quarterly journal,<i> Behavior
	  Science Notes</i> (Volume 6, No. 3), reviewing the development and contemporary
	  problems of the OCM. These articles by Clellan S. Ford and Frank W. Moore,
	  the former President and Executive Director of HRAF, respectively, are well
	  worth reading by anyone seriously interested in the utilization of the OCM
	  or in the general issue of subject classification systems in the social/behavioral
	  sciences.</P>
	<p>Of particular interest here is the point emphasized by Moore that the OCM
	  is sometimes regarded as a static product of the scholarship of the 1930s,
	  whereas nothing could be further from the truth. &quot;The OCM has changed
	  and rechanged in literally thousands of ways since its inception.&quot;
	  It is &quot;constantly being revised and rethought&quot; (p. 189).</p>
	<p>In the fifty-one years that the HRAF research staff has been applying the
	  OCM to the classification of descriptive information on cultures throughout
	  the world, the OCM has been found to be both a highly flexible and adaptive
	  system and an intricately integrated system. New concepts have been linked
	  to existing subject categories, and categories have been modified and expanded
	  to cover new ranges of information. Occasionally, and only after careful
	  consideration of all possible ramifications that can be envisaged, new subject
	  categories have been added to the OCM (see the preface for examples of categories
	  added or modified for this version). Care must be taken not to change the
	  system too radically so as not to lose continuity with the hundreds of thousands
	  of text pages that have already been classified according to the OCM system
	  in the HRAF Files.</P>
	<p>Many of the above considerations are well-exemplified in HRAFs attempt
	  to introduce a new group of subject categories in 1977-79. At that time,
	  HRAF decided to build some Files on modern urban areas and to consider developing
	  new types of Files on modern national states or sectors of such states.
	  It was thought that a number of new categories would be needed to handle
	  new kinds of urban data and large amounts of information on intermediate
	  levels of administrative-political units between local communities and national
	  governments. After much discussion, four new major category divisions were
	  considered: Towns, Cities, Districts, and Provinces. Of course, each of
	  these major divisions were subdivided into several three-digit categories.
	  These new categories were to supersede the categories in division 630, where
	  there is only one three-digit category for each of the four administrative
	  levels. The first opportunity to test this new group of categories came
	  with the development of the Okayama File (<i>Outline of World Cultures</i>
	  code, AB43). The File unit is Okayama Prefecture within the modern state
	  of Japan; it contains both rural and urban areas, and the data cover all
	  administrative-political levels. The net result was that the use of these
	  new categories was discontinued after completion of the Okayama File. The
	  new categories proved to be too cumbersome and created more difficulties
	  than they solved. <SUP><a href="note4.htm">4</a></SUP> </p>
