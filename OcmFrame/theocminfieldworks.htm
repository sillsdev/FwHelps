  <h2>The Outline of Cultural Materials in <i>FieldWorks</i></h2>
  <h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Introduction</h3>
  <div class=SubmoduleBody> 
    <p>FieldWorks incorporates the <a href="theoutlineofculturalmaterialso.htm"
	  title="The Outline of Cultural Materials is a numerical system for categorizing cultural data for purposes of research. It is usually referred to by its initials, OCM.">Outline 
      of Cultural Materials</a> (OCM) and <a href="frameworkforresearchandmethodo.htm"
	  title="The Framework for Research and Methodology in Ethnography (FRAME) is a higher level topic outline under which the many categories of the Outline of Cultural Materials (OCM) have been grouped.">FRAME</a> 
      as a system for categorizing fieldnotes and language data. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data categorization is the process of systematically referencing data 
        so that it can be found and organized according to a previously devised 
        conceptual framework.</li>
      <li>Consistently recorded cultural observations are the raw data needed 
        for language and cultural learning, research, and translation. Categorizing 
        raw data with topical codes like the OCM builds into your data a powerful 
        analytical tool for cultural discovery. </li>
    </ul>

  <h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Choosing an OCM category in Fieldworks</h3>
  <div class=SubmoduleBody> 
    <p>There are several ways to determine which OCM categories to use to &#147;categorize&#148; 
      an entry in the Data Notebook:<br>
    </p>
    <div class=SubmoduleBody> 
      <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td width=50% valign=top class="Normal"> 
            <p><b>If this is your situation:</b></p>
          </td>
          <td width=50% valign=top class="Normal"> 
            <p><b>Do this:</b></p>
          </td>
	    </tr>
      </table>
      <table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
        <tr> 
          <td width=50% valign=top class="Normal"> 
            <p>In a hurry or unfamiliar with the OCM?</p>
          </td>
          <td width=50% valign=top class="Normal"> 
            <p>Tag entry with one of the eleven <a href="framecategories.htm" title="FRAME Categories"> 
              FRAME categories</a>.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td width=50% valign=top class="Normal"> 
            <p>Uncertain which OCM code to use?</p>
          </td>
          <td width=50% valign=top class="Normal"> 
            <p>Select &#147;More&#148; in the OCM Chooser dialog box, click on 
              the <span class=PageNavigation><a href="indexframe.htm">Index</a></span> 
              hotlink, then enter an approximate word in the Index entry box and 
              choose a code from among the options provided. </p>

        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td width=50% valign=top class="Normal">

          </td>
          <td width=50% valign=top class="Normal"> 
            <p>Browse through the OCM topics list to find the appropriate category 
              (either major or subcategory)</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td width=50% valign=top class="Normal"> 
            <p>Know the topic and correct OCM code</p>
          </td>
          <td width=50% valign=top class="Normal"> 
            <p>Use the Data Notebook&#146;s type-ahead feature and begin entering 
              either the OCM number or title directly in the field. </p>

  <h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Using coded entries in FieldWorks Data Notebook</h3>
  <div class=SubmoduleBody> 
    <p>FieldWorks Data Notebook provides several ways to use data that has been 
      categorized with OCM codes. <br></p>
    <p><b>Analysis Tools</b></p>
      <div class=SubmoduleBody> 
        <p><i>Filters</i> and <i>Sort Methods</i> are two analytical tools in 
          FieldWorks that allow you to </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Compile subsets of entries based on specific information (e.g. 
            entries with a particular OCM category). </li>
          <li> Arrange entries based on the information in a specified field (e.g. 
            Anthropology Categories/OCM).<br>
          </li>
		</ul>
	  </div>
      <div class=SubmoduleBody><i><b>Sort Methods</b></i>
        <div class=SubmoduleBody>
          <p>Using this analytical tool, you can arrange your data based on the 
            OCM categories included in the entries. Once entries are displayed 
            sorted in this way, you can use this feature to note the range of 
            topics you have covered in your data, and determine how many entries 
            occur for each category. </p>
          <p>You can also create more complex sort methods. For example, you could 
            first sort your data by Location or Source, and then by OCM category 
            in order to see what types of information you have collected from 
            each place or person. </p>
          </div>
		  </div>
        <div class=SubmoduleBody><i><b>Filters</b></i>
        <div class=SubmoduleBody><p>Filters display only those entries that match filter criteria. 
          There are two kinds of filters: </p>
          <ul>           
              <li><b>Simple filters</b><i><b> </b></i>&#151; display entries that match <b>one</b> filter criteria</li>
                <div class=SubmoduleBody>Examples of simple filters using OCM categories:
                  <ul>                  
                  <li>display only entries classified with a specific OCM category</li>
                  <li>display only entires classified with a specific OCM category 
                    and all its related subcategories </li>
                  <li>display all entries that are not yet tagged with any OCM category</li>
				  </ul>
                </div>
              
            <div class=SubmoduleBody> 
              <p>Note: Filters can be built using criteria other than OCM categories 
                (e.g. Location, Source, Date of Event)<br>
              </p>
            </div>
            <li><b>Complex filters</b><i><b> </b></i>&#151; display entries that match <b>two or more</b> filter criteria</li>
              <div class=SubmoduleBody>Examples of complex filters using OCM categories:
                <ul>
                  <li> display entries that contain multiple groupings of OCM categories</li>
                  <li> display entries which contain one or more OCM categories 
                       <u>and</u> were obtained from a specified source.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
		   </ul>
		 </div>
      </div>
	</div>
  </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div class=SubmoduleBody><b>Views</b> 
        <div class=SubmoduleBody>
        <p>There are three different ways to look at your data. Certain views 
          are especially useful after the application of a Filter or a Sort Method.</p>
          <p><i><b>Data Entry </b></i></p> 
        <div class=SubmoduleBody> 
            <p>Read through filtered entries one at a time. This is the view normally 
              used to enter data.</p>
          </div>
          <i><b>Browse </b></i> 
		    <div class=SubmoduleBody>
            <p>A bird's eye view of your data with entries displayed in rows; 
              each row showing selected fields. When used in combination with 
              Filters and Sort Methods, this view is a quick way to see what is 
              there in your field notes without a lot of extra clutter.</p>
		  </div>
          <i><b>Document</b></i>
		    <div class=SubmoduleBody>
            <p>Read selected information from a continuous set of field notes. 
              This is the easiest way to read through relevant information from 
              your field notes without having to switch screens for each entry. 
              Simply scroll through the entries as if they were a single document. 
              When used in combination with Filters, this view shows only a subset 
              of your field notes; in essence giving a summary report of field 
              notes which meet the filter criteria.</p>
			</div>
        </div>
        <div class=SubmoduleBody>
    <p>Note: Your are not restricted to these three preconfigured views. You can 
      modify this views, and you can create any number of customized views based 
      on these three types<i><b> </b></i>&#151; hiding and showing, reordering, 
      or modifying the look of any field as needed.</p>
