<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Description</h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>With end-blown flutes, the airstream is directed against the sharp rim of the open upper end of a pipe by a player's lips. There are a variety of ways the end can be cut to obtain an edge. </P>
<P>The number of finger holes is usually under four.  </P>
<P>Materials used for flutes include horn, wood, bamboo, animal bone, metal, and even PVC pipe!  </P>
<P>Traditional flutes are often "sight tuned," that is, the holes are placed where the fingers conveniently fall or where it looks good to put a hole, rather than boring the holes to produce a certain pitch.  </P>
<P>The end-blown flute may be a single flute or a set of pipes of graduated length arranged in a row. There may be a double row.  This set of pipes is different from panpipes in that the tubes of panpipes have no finger holes and the lower end is usually stopped. </P>
