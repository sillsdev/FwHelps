<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Description</h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>Musical training methods and procedures will often vary according to the predominant learning style in a culture and will be influenced by the personal learning/teaching style of the teacher. Music appreciation will be influenced by what constitutes an aesthetic experience within the culture, which may not be based on "beauty" as Westerners consider it.  </P>
