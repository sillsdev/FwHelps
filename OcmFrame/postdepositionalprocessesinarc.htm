<h2>138 Post Depositional Processes in Archaeological Sites</h2>
<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Description</h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>Discussions of how an archaeological site, its cultural strata, and its artifacts and non-artifactual constituents were affected by the natural and cultural environment after being deposited and before being excavated. These processes include erosion, floods, animal use of the site such as pack rat middens or animal burrows, taphonomic processes not discussed elsewhere, looting of the site,  human disturbances of the site and its artifacts, and differential preservation of artifacts and non-artifactual constituents.</P>
<P>This term was introduced in 1997. The description was updated in 2000.</P>
