<h2>The HRAF Collections   </h2>
<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading> <B>The Collection of Ethnography</B></h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>The HRAF Collection of Ethnography (referred to in earlier days as the "HRAF Files"), just as the Files of the earlier Cross-Cultural Survey, constitute both a major cultural data archive and a rapid and efficient data retrieval system. Specifically, the Files are a continually expanding collection of mostly primary source materials (i.e., published books and articles plus some unpublished manuscripts) on a large sample of cultures, societies, and ethnic groups representing all areas of the world. The materials include many rare sources not generally available and many exclusive English translations of foreign-language texts. The structure of the collection differs in the electronic version, but to understand the fruitfulness of the collection, it is best to explain the structure in both the paper and microfiche versions.</P>
<P>Generally, there are separate Files for each distinct cultural or ethnic group, and in the paper and microfiche versions, the information is arranged within each file according to the subject classification system of the OCM. Each text page of every source selected for inclusion in each File has been analyzed and annotated in the margin with the category number of every subject treated on that page. In the paper and microfiche versions the page is then reproduced in multiples to provide a copy for inclusion in each applicable subject category within that File. Thus, all materials dealing with a particular subject are brought together under a single subject category within each File. This is the process that transforms the HRAF Files into a data retrieval system. In the eHRAF or electronic version, the appropriate OCMs have been placed at the top of every paragraph in the text and the OCMs are also attached to other elements such as graphics, tables, and footnotes. There is no need in the electronic version to arrange the files by OCM codes because when a search is made for a particular OCM in the electronic version, the appropriate passages appear as "hits." Searching in the electronic collection can also be done with words, combinations of words, or a combination of word(s) and OCM categories.</P>
<P>Any problem in the human sciences requiring analysis of the literature on a number of different societies can usually be studied with the use of the Files in an fraction of the time needed to accomplish the same work through the ordinary techniques of library research. Even if its solution requires other methods, a brief pilot study in the Files will often indicate whether or not the project as conceived is feasible, or the hypothesis as formulated is likely to be validated. Basically, the Files are intended as an aid to research in the human sciences, not as a substitute for other types of research.</P>
<P>But how good are the Files as an aid to research? A key issue is the effectiveness of the Files as an information retrieval system for sociocultural data. In other words, to what extent can researchers expect to find the information they want correctly classified in the Files? The accuracy of the Files is in large part dependent upon the consistency or reliability with which the information in the Files is categorized. HRAF's research staff has made a number of studies of "analysis" or "coding" reliability, that is, of the degree of agreement between independent analysts in the classification of information in the Files according to the OCM subject categories. The results of these studies range from good to excellent depending upon the degree of stringency used in determining agreement.</P>
<P>The average level of absolute agreement for all subject categories used was 60 percent (quite good when one recalls there are over 700 categories involved), while the average level of major category agreement ranged from 88 percent when absolute agreement was measured to 91 percent when mutual cross-references and adjacent categories were taken into consideration. (A major category is defined as the single OCM category which the analysts consider to best characterize the bulk of data on each page.) Thus these studies indicate that a user of the Files may expect to find up to 91% of the <U>major topics</U> described in a source appropriately classified by subject categories. (Note: Starting in 1974, reports of these reliability studies were published in <I>Behavior Science Research</I> and should be consulted there for further details.)</P>
<P>Among other factors determining the value of the HRAF Files for research are their range and depth of coverage. As of September 2000, there were more than 360 Files (societies, ethnic groups, countries, etc.), including approximately 1,000,000 text pages. English translations from at least 15 different foreign languages appear exclusively in the Files. Thus it can be argued that the HRAF Files constitute a unique and major information resource in the human sciences.</P>
<P>The Files are designed for all the sciences that are concerned with human behavior in broad perspective, i.e., with establishing valid principles not limited in time or space, and HRAF has committed itself to the same policy. The Board of Directors of HRAF, as a matter of fact, officially decided to develop the Files so that they would serve alike all the universal, as opposed to the culture-bound human disciplines, and at that time defined the universal sciences as including sociology, cultural anthropology, psychology, human biology, and geography. This policy has not changed but simply broadened to include those truly cross-cultural subfields that have developed within other disciplines in more recent years.</P>
<P>Originally, the HRAF Files were produced only in a paper format. The need for a wider distribution of the Files than was possible with the paper version led to the production beginning in 1958 of a microfilm version utilizing unitized microfilm. Approximately 90,000 to 100,000 File pages (about 20,000 original pages) were filmed each year and distributed in microfiche format to participating institutions in the United States and other countries. In 1993, with installment 42, microfiche production ended. Annual installments of the HRAF Collection of Ethnography are now distributed to members on the World Wide Web (eHRAF: Ethnography); as of 2001 there are seven installments available: 43,44, 45,46,47,48, and 49. While material on microfiche remains available, all materials added since 1994 (as well as retrospective conversions and updates of existing materials) are available only in electronic form. Each electronic installment consists of about 40,000 pages a year. Approximately 40% of each electronic installment is new material not already in the microfiche files.</P>

<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>The eHRAFCollection of Archaeology</h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
	<P>The eHRAF Collection of Archaeology is modeled after the eHRAF Collection
	  of Ethnography, except that the unit of analysis is the "archaeological
	  tradition" rather than a culture. The units have been drawn from a preliminary
	  version of the <I>Outline of Archaeological Traditions </I>(OAT) constructed
	  by Peter N. Peregrine with a distinguished Board of Advisors. The first
	  edition of the OAT will appear shortly. Just like eHRAF Ethnography, eHRAF
	  Archaeology consists of full-text sources (including books, journal articles,
	  dissertations, and manuscripts) that are indexed with OCMs for quick and
	  precise retrieval of information. To enhance comparative research from the
	  outset, the first traditions have been randomly selected from the OAT. Each
	  tradition contains a brief summary, some expanded overviews of the major
	  tradition, and more detailed reports of specific sites within the tradition.
	  The first annual installment appeared in 1999; the second in 2000; and the
	  third in 2001. As of 2001, there are 25 randomly selected traditions (with
	  about 35,000 pages of text) containing information on prehistoric life and
	  cultural sequences. With installment 3, HRAF begins to fill in the temporal
	  sequences that surround the randomly chosen traditions. So, for example,
	  the Classic Maya was randomly selected for installment 2 and in installment
	  3 we include the lowland Mesoamerican Archaic and the Preclassic Maya, the
	  traditions prior to the Classic Maya phase. We also include the Postclassic
	  Maya, the tradition following the Classic Maya. For more information about
	  the traditions in the eHRAF Collection of Archaeology, see HRAF's home page
