  <h2>5331s Scale</h2>
<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Description</h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>Roughly speaking, scale is a list of the frequencies (in physics terms) or pitches which occur in a musical piece or music system.  The term "scale" usually also implies that certain relationships between pitches exist, e.g., that certain pitches usually follow others. If these relationships are unknown it may be more appropriate to speak of a pitch inventory and/or tonal center(s). </P>

<CAPTION align=top><B>Kinds of scale</B></CAPTION>
<TR><TD valign=top rowspan=1 width="192"> Gapped scale
<TD>
Scale with less than seven notes per octave as found in our system. Not a good term because it implies that something is missing.
<TR><TD valign=top rowspan=2 width="192"> Pentatonic scale
<TD>
Five-note scale. This is a legitimate term but really tells us nothing except
<TR><TD>
that there are five notes. The <I>tonal pentatonic</I> or <I>anhemitonic pentatonic scale</I> is a five-note scale with no semitones. It is fairly common throughout the world and corresponds roughly to the black notes on the piano.
<TR><TD valign=top rowspan=1 width="192"> Raga
<TD>
A term used in (East) Indian musicology that includes the concept of scale but also implies much more, such as the relationship of the notes and even melodic themes. Different ragas are associated with different concepts such as fire and the time of day.
<TR><TD valign=top rowspan=1 width="192"> Range
<TD>
The pitch difference between the lowest and highest notes used in a musical composition. This term is also used to describe the absolute highest and lowest notes normally sung by a certain voice (for example, tenor, soprano) or normally played on an instrument.
<TR><TD valign=top rowspan=1 width="192"> Tonal center
<TD>
The pitch around which the musical piece revolves.
<TR><TD valign=top rowspan=1 width="192"> Modulation
<TD>
Change of tonal center or key within a composition.
