<h2>Plan of the <I>Outline of Cultural Materials</I>   </h2>
<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading> </h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P> The <I>Outline of Cultural Materials </I>has been devised with two primary purposes in mind: first, to assist scholars in annotating and classifying cultural materials from all societies and, second, to aid researchers in locating readily in the HRAF Files the material pertinent to their interests. These objectives have necessitated a single standard system of organization into which all cultural and background material can be fitted for any society from the simplest to the most complex. It is fully realized that cultures differ enormously, not only in the elements that they do or do not contain, but also in the configurations into which their elements are organized. However, the adoption of a distinctive system of classification for each culture, adapted to its particular content and institutions, would require users of the Files to master the unique organization of each culture before they could locate any item of specific information about it. The authors have therefore chosen an elaboration of what Wissler called "the universal culture pattern." In consequence, the reader must expect to find classified under the same heading such superficially divergent phenomena as the shaman and the modern psychoanalyst under Category 756 (formally called Psychotherapists; now retitled Shamans and Psychotherapists), and the quarrying of flint with hand tools with the contemporary activities of the Anaconda Copper Company under Category 316 (Mining and Quarrying). Similarly, there is no special category like "Christianity," pertaining to only a limited number of cultures, but only general categories like 779 (Theological Systems).</P>
	<P>The system of classification used in the OCM divides all cultural and background
	  information into 82 major divisions and into 659 minor divisions. The major
	  divisions can be thought of as two-digit categories (numbered from 10 through
	  91 in paper and fiche; in electronic formats a zero is added, so that the
	  first major category is 100 and the second is 110). The minor divisions
	  are three or four digit categories, numbered by adding digits (usually 1
	  to 9, but may go up to 13) to the numbers of the sections under which they
	  fall. It should be noted that the major categories in the paper and microfiche
	  are sequenced as though they were three-digit categories, with the last
	  digit a zero. In other words, Category 29 does not come immediately after
	  28 but instead follows 289; it does not immediately precede 30 but instead
	  precedes 291. These sub-categories normally provide an appropriate place
	  for every item of information encountered in the cultures processed by HRAF
	  <SUP><a href="note2.htm">2</a></SUP> . Materials not readily classifiable
	  under any existing three-digit or four-digit category are filed under the
	  appropriate major category. Materials of a summary nature touching briefly
	  on several specific three-digit categories will generally be classified
	  under the major category. In the paper or fiche collections, the use of
	  an asterisk with a major category in a cross-reference (e.g., 61*) indicates
	  that three or more subcategories within that major topical division may
	  contain information pertinent to the category from which the cross-reference
	  is being made.</P>
<P>Following the number and title of each category in the OCM is a brief descriptive statement indicating the range of information to be filed or sought under that particular heading. It is impossible, of course, to do more than suggest the immense variety of possible specific content. Beneath the statement, there normally appears a list of cross-references to other categories under which related material is filed. These cross-references are presented in tabular form in numerical order.</P>
<P>Being designed for universal application, the categories are naturally not mutually exclusive for every individual culture. Some overlap is inevitable. For this reason closely related categories are normally grouped in the same section and, wherever possible, adjacent to one another. In the case of material that overlaps two or more categories, a decision is made as to which is the more appropriate and the material is classified there. Information is not ordinarily classified for two categories that are cross-referenced to each other or located in the same section unless a clear-cut distinction between categories of the same major division can be made.</P>
<P>The authors have frequently been asked to elucidate the theoretical principles underlying the system of classification. They admit only that they have attempted to group inherently related categories in the same section and that they have arranged the sections in an order that is not wholly without logic. Beyond this, however, they insist that the classification is wholly pragmatic. Through trial and error, the categories have come to represent a sort of common denominator of the ways in which anthropologists, geographers, sociologists, historians, and other recorders of cultural data habitually organize their materials.</P>
