<h2>Preface </h2>
<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Fifth Edition, with Modifications, 2000</h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
	<P>The <I>Outline of Cultural Materials</I> (OCM) is a manual that presents a
	  comprehensive subject classification system pertaining to human behavior.
	  Together with a companion volume, the <I>Outline of World Cultures</I> (OWC),
	  the OCM is used by the Human Relations Area Files, Inc. to subject-index
	  ethnographic and archaeological material at the paragraph level in its Collection
	  of Ethnography and the new Collection of Archaeology. The annually growing
	  Collection of Ethnography currently contains nearly one million pages of
	  information on more than 360 cultures of the world, past and present. As
	  of the winter of 2000, 78 cultural files are available on the Web. The Human
	  Relations Area Files, Inc. (HRAF) is a not-for-profit international consortium
	  of educational and research institutions; the production of the collections
	  is supported by membership dues. For more information about the Collections,
	  see <TT><a href="http://www.yale.edu/hraf">http://www.yale.edu/hraf</a></TT>.</P>
<P>To be useful, any classification scheme requires modification to adapt to new kinds of data and new analytical approaches. But modification needs to be tempered by the understanding that it is not practical to go back and re-index the more than a million pages already in the ethnographic collection. The HRAF staff tries to adhere to a moderate course of change. Our current practice is to include history notes within the OCM categories whenever there are significant changes in categories, including deletions, additions, or substantial rewording.</P>
<P>The impetus for many of the changes introduced in this volume came from the need to modify the OCM to subject-index the new Collection of Archaeology. When the HRAF staff first reviewed the OCM to see what categories would be additionally needed, to our surprise there were surprisingly few. After reflection, we decided that it really should not have been surprising because the OCM was, after all, designed to index cultural materials! Most of the 13 new categories for archaeology fell under two major OCM categories: Research Methods (formerly called Methodology) and a new category called Archaeological Measures, Techniques and Analyses. Under Research Methods (120) we added the subcategories of 129 Archaeological Survey Methods; 1210 Archaeological Excavation Methods; 1211 Dating Methods in Archaeology; 1212 Laboratory Analysis of Materials Other than Dating Methods in Archaeology; and 1213 Comparative Data. In the new category called Archaeological Measures, Techniques and Analyses (910) we added: 911 Chronologies and Culture Sequences; 912 Cultural Stratigraphy; 913 Functional Specialization Areas; 914 Typologies and Classifications; and 915 Archaeological Inventories. In addition, under the main category 100 called Orientation, we added 107 Diagnostic Material Attributes, under 110 (Information Sources) we added 119 Artifact and Archive Collections, and under Geography (130) we added 138 Post-Depositional Processes in Archaeological Sites.</P>
<P>Some category additions were made in response to changing interests in ethnography. Three changes in particular warranted new categories, in our opinion. The first was an explicit category called Gender Roles and Issues (890). A second was an interest in text, particularly narratives in the native language. Accordingly, we created a general category called Texts (900). Under the text category, we decided to differentiate Texts in the Speaker's Language (901) from Texts Translated into English (902), and Inter-linear Translations (903). In creating these new categories, we retired the categories of literature (538) and literary texts (539). We also decided to add the categories of Verbal Arts (5310) and Visual Arts (5311) and retire the previous distinctions made between decorative art and representative art (previously 531 and 532). Our notes in each category, retired or new, tell the user how to search for material prior to the change.</P>
<P>We also made a considerable number of changes in wording to make the categories more in line with contemporary usage and sensibility. For example, category 195 Stylistics was revised to Sociolinguistics and 304 Mutilation was revised to Body Alteration.</P>
	<P>The HRAF staff, including M. Marlene Martin, John Beierle, lan Skoggard,
	  Sarah Berry, and myself, hold regular meetings to discuss the updating of
	  the OCM categories. M. Marlene Martin is also responsible for creating and
	  maintaining a database version of the OCM that can be readily updated. We
	  plan to have an experimental <I>alphabetic</I> version of the <I>Outline
	  of Cultural Materials</I> available on the Web soon (see our home page <tt><a href="http://www.yale.edu/hraf">http://www.yale.edu/hraf</a>
	  </tt>and click on "Using the Collections"). The numeric version of the OCM
	  will also be on our home page shortly. We solicit reactions and comments.</P>
<P>For those interested in the historical development of the <I>Outline of Cultural Materials</I>, the changes occurring in each addition are outlined in a series of prefaces. These prefaces are all included in the 5th edition published in 1987.</P>
