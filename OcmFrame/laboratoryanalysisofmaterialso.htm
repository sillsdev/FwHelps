<h2>1212 Laboratory Analysis of Materials other than Dating Methods in Archaeology</h2>
<h3 class=SubmoduleHeading>Description</h3>
<div class=SubmoduleBody>
<P>Descriptions of archaeological laboratory methods including physiochemical analysis methods  in archaeology such as X-ray spectrometry, neutron activation of trace elements, mineralogy, and palynology; how and where the artifacts and non-artifactual constituents were processed once they were excavated; techniques and equipment used; problems encountered, etc. This category includes descriptions of methods used to analyze faunal and floral remains for archaeological and non-archaeological purposes (e.g., analysis of plants for their pharmacological properties, shellfish analysis, laboratory analyses for ethnographic studies not found elsewhere, etc.</P>
<P>This term was introduced in 1997. The description was rewritten completely in 2000.</P>
